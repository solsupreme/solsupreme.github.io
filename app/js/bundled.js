/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $animateCss
 * @kind object
 *
 * @description
 * The `$animateCss` service is a useful utility to trigger customized CSS-based transitions/keyframes
 * from a JavaScript-based animation or directly from a directive. The purpose of `$animateCss` is NOT
 * to side-step how `$animate` and ngAnimate work, but the goal is to allow pre-existing animations or
 * directives to create more complex animations that can be purely driven using CSS code.
 *
 * Note that only browsers that support CSS transitions and/or keyframe animations are capable of
 * rendering animations triggered via `$animateCss` (bad news for IE9 and lower).
 *
 * ## Usage
 * Once again, `$animateCss` is designed to be used inside of a registered JavaScript animation that
 * is powered by ngAnimate. It is possible to use `$animateCss` directly inside of a directive, however,
 * any automatic control over cancelling animations and/or preventing animations from being run on
 * child elements will not be handled by Angular. For this to work as expected, please use `$animate` to
 * trigger the animation and then setup a JavaScript animation that injects `$animateCss` to trigger
 * the CSS animation.
 *
 * The example below shows how we can create a folding animation on an element using `ng-if`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- notice the `fold-animation` CSS class -->
 * <div ng-if="onOff" class="fold-animation">
 *   This element will go BOOM
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="onOff=true">Fold In</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Now we create the **JavaScript animation** that will trigger the CSS transition:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         from: { height:'0px' },
 *         to: { height:height + 'px' },
 *         duration: 1 // one second
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## More Advanced Uses
 *
 * `$animateCss` is the underlying code that ngAnimate uses to power **CSS-based animations** behind the scenes. Therefore CSS hooks
 * like `.ng-EVENT`, `.ng-EVENT-active`, `.ng-EVENT-stagger` are all features that can be triggered using `$animateCss` via JavaScript code.
 *
 * This also means that just about any combination of adding classes, removing classes, setting styles, dynamically setting a keyframe animation,
 * applying a hardcoded duration or delay value, changing the animation easing or applying a stagger animation are all options that work with
 * `$animateCss`. The service itself is smart enough to figure out the combination of options and examine the element styling properties in order
 * to provide a working animation that will run in CSS.
 *
 * The example below showcases a more advanced version of the `.fold-animation` from the example above:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         addClass: 'red large-text pulse-twice',
 *         easing: 'ease-out',
 *         from: { height:'0px' },
 *         to: { height:height + 'px' },
 *         duration: 1 // one second
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Since we're adding/removing CSS classes then the CSS transition will also pick those up:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; since a hardcoded duration value of 1 was provided in the JavaScript animation code,
 * the CSS classes below will be transitioned despite them being defined as regular CSS classes &#42;/
 * .red { background:red; }
 * .large-text { font-size:20px; }
 *
 * /&#42; we can also use a keyframe animation and $animateCss will make it work alongside the transition &#42;/
 * .pulse-twice {
 *   animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;
 *   -webkit-animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes pulse {
 *   from { transform: scale(0.5); }
 *   to { transform: scale(1.5); }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes pulse {
 *   from { -webkit-transform: scale(0.5); }
 *   to { -webkit-transform: scale(1.5); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Given this complex combination of CSS classes, styles and options, `$animateCss` will figure everything out and make the animation happen.
 *
 * ## How the Options are handled
 *
 * `$animateCss` is very versatile and intelligent when it comes to figuring out what configurations to apply to the element to ensure the animation
 * works with the options provided. Say for example we were adding a class that contained a keyframe value and we wanted to also animate some inline
 * styles using the `from` and `to` properties.
 *
 * ```js
 * var animator = $animateCss(element, {
 *   from: { background:'red' },
 *   to: { background:'blue' }
 * });
 * animator.start();
 * ```
 *
 * ```css
 * .rotating-animation {
 *   animation:0.5s rotate linear;
 *   -webkit-animation:0.5s rotate linear;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes rotate {
 *   from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
 *   to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes rotate {
 *   from { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); }
 *   to { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The missing pieces here are that we do not have a transition set (within the CSS code nor within the `$animateCss` options) and the duration of the animation is
 * going to be detected from what the keyframe styles on the CSS class are. In this event, `$animateCss` will automatically create an inline transition
 * style matching the duration detected from the keyframe style (which is present in the CSS class that is being added) and then prepare both the transition
 * and keyframe animations to run in parallel on the element. Then when the animation is underway the provided `from` and `to` CSS styles will be applied
 * and spread across the transition and keyframe animation.
 *
 * ## What is returned
 *
 * `$animateCss` works in two stages: a preparation phase and an animation phase. Therefore when `$animateCss` is first called it will NOT actually
 * start the animation. All that is going on here is that the element is being prepared for the animation (which means that the generated CSS classes are
 * added and removed on the element). Once `$animateCss` is called it will return an object with the following properties:
 *
 * ```js
 * var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });
 * ```
 *
 * Now what do the contents of our `animator` variable look like:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   // starts the animation
 *   start: Function,
 *
 *   // ends (aborts) the animation
 *   end: Function
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To actually start the animation we need to run `animation.start()` which will then return a promise that we can hook into to detect when the animation ends.
 * If we choose not to run the animation then we MUST run `animation.end()` to perform a cleanup on the element (since some CSS classes and stlyes may have been
 * applied to the element during the preparation phase). Note that all other properties such as duration, delay, transitions and keyframes are just properties
 * and that changing them will not reconfigure the parameters of the animation.
 *
 * ### runner.done() vs runner.then()
 * It is documented that `animation.start()` will return a promise object and this is true, however, there is also an additional method available on the
 * runner called `.done(callbackFn)`. The done method works the same as `.finally(callbackFn)`, however, it does **not trigger a digest to occur**.
 * Therefore, for performance reasons, it's always best to use `runner.done(callback)` instead of `runner.then()`, `runner.catch()` or `runner.finally()`
 * unless you really need a digest to kick off afterwards.
 *
 * Keep in mind that, to make this easier, ngAnimate has tweaked the JS animations API to recognize when a runner instance is returned from $animateCss
 * (so there is no need to call `runner.done(doneFn)` inside of your JavaScript animation code). Check the [animation code above](#usage) to see how this works.
 *
 * @param {DOMElement} element the element that will be animated
 * @param {object} options the animation-related options that will be applied during the animation
 *
 * * `event` - The DOM event (e.g. enter, leave, move). When used, a generated CSS class of `ng-EVENT` and `ng-EVENT-active` will be applied
 * to the element during the animation. Multiple events can be provided when spaces are used as a separator. (Note that this will not perform any DOM operation.)
 * * `easing` - The CSS easing value that will be applied to the transition or keyframe animation (or both).
 * * `transition` - The raw CSS transition style that will be used (e.g. `1s linear all`).
 * * `keyframe` - The raw CSS keyframe animation style that will be used (e.g. `1s my_animation linear`).
 * * `from` - The starting CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied at the start of the animation.
 * * `to` - The ending CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied across the animation via a CSS transition.
 * * `addClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be added to the element and spread across the animation.
 * * `removeClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be removed from the element and spread across the animation.
 * * `duration` - A number value representing the total duration of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `0`
 * is provided then the animation will be skipped entirely.
 * * `delay` - A number value representing the total delay of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `true` is
 * used then whatever delay value is detected from the CSS classes will be mirrored on the elements styles (e.g. by setting delay true then the style value
 * of the element will be `transition-delay: DETECTED_VALUE`). Using `true` is useful when you want the CSS classes and inline styles to all share the same
 * CSS delay value.
 * * `stagger` - A numeric time value representing the delay between successively animated elements
 * ({@link ngAnimate#css-staggering-animations Click here to learn how CSS-based staggering works in ngAnimate.})
 * * `staggerIndex` - The numeric index representing the stagger item (e.g. a value of 5 is equal to the sixth item in the stagger; therefore when a
 * `stagger` option value of `0.1` is used then there will be a stagger delay of `600ms`)
 * `applyClassesEarly` - Whether or not the classes being added or removed will be used when detecting the animation. This is set by `$animate` when enter/leave/move animations are fired to ensure that the CSS classes are resolved in time. (Note that this will prevent any transitions from occuring on the classes being added and removed.)
 *
 * @return {object} an object with start and end methods and details about the animation.
 *
 * * `start` - The method to start the animation. This will return a `Promise` when called.
 * * `end` - This method will cancel the animation and remove all applied CSS classes and styles.

/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for CSS-based animations (keyframes and transitions) as well as JavaScript-based animations via
 * callback hooks. Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including `ngAnimate` then the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 * Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The former works purely based
 * using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via `module.animation()`. For
 * both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching `CSS class` that exists both in the registered animation and within
 * the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.
 *
 * ## Directive Support
 * The following directives are "animation aware":
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |
 *

 *
 * ## CSS-based Animations
 *
 * CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML
 * and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an the underlying directive performs an operation.
 *
 * The example below shows how an `enter` animation can be made possible on a element using `ng-if`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-if="bool" class="fade">
 *    Fade me in out
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="bool=true">Fade In!</button>
 * <button ng-click="bool=false">Fade Out!</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice the CSS class **fade**? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-enter {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what's going on) two
 * generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active`. For CSS transitions, the transition
 * code **must** be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case `.ng-enter`). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.
 *
 * If for example we wanted to create animations for `leave` and `move` (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-leave {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We can also make use of **CSS Keyframes** by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; there is no need to define anything inside of the destination
 * CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-leave {
 *   animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
 *   -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes my_fade_animation {
 *   from { opacity:1; }
 *   to { opacity:0; }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {
 *   from { opacity:1; }
 *   to { opacity:0; }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.
 *
 * ### CSS Class-based Animations
 *
 * Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via `ngClass`, `ngShow`, `ngHide` and some other directives) have a slightly different
 * naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added
 * and removed.
 *
 * For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for `ngHide` then we place an animation on the `.ng-hide` CSS class:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-show="bool" class="fade">
 *   Show and hide me
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="bool=true">Toggle</button>
 *
 * <style>
 * .fade.ng-hide {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * </style>
 * ```
 *
 * All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the `.ng-hide` class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since
 * ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.
 *
 * In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation
 * with CSS styles.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="{on:onOff}" class="highlight">
 *   Highlight this box
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="onOff=!onOff">Toggle</button>
 *
 * <style>
 * .highlight {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * .highlight.on-add {
 *   background:white;
 * }
 * .highlight.on {
 *   background:yellow;
 * }
 * .highlight.on-remove {
 *   background:black;
 * }
 * </style>
 * ```
 *
 * We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.
 *
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then the duration value
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to `$animate` were fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 *
 *   $scope.$digest();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ### The `ng-animate` CSS class
 *
 * When ngAnimate is animating an element it will apply the `ng-animate` CSS class to the element for the duration of the animation.
 * This is a temporary CSS class and it will be removed once the animation is over (for both JavaScript and CSS-based animations).
 *
 * Therefore, animations can be applied to an element using this temporary class directly via CSS.
 *
 * ```css
 * .zipper.ng-animate {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-enter {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-leave {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that the `ng-animate` CSS class is reserved and it cannot be applied on an element directly since ngAnimate will always remove
 * the CSS class once an animation has completed.)
 *
 *
 * ## JavaScript-based Animations
 *
 * ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared
 * CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the
 * `module.animation()` module function we can register the ainmation.
 *
 * Let's see an example of a enter/leave animation using `ngRepeat`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-repeat="item in items" class="slide">
 *   {{ item }}
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * See the **slide** CSS class? Let's use that class to define an animation that we'll structure in our module code by using `module.animation`:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)
 *     // have different function input parameters
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
 *
 *       // remember to call doneFn so that angular
 *       // knows that the animation has concluded
 *     },
 *
 *     move: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
 *     },
 *
 *     leave: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as
 * greensock.js and velocity.js.
 *
 * If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like `ngClass`, `ngHide` and `ngShow` triggers it) then we can still define
 * our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="color" class="colorful">
 *   this box is moody
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="color='red'">Change to red</button>
 * <button ng-click="color='blue'">Change to blue</button>
 * <button ng-click="color='green'">Change to green</button>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.colorful', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     },
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     },
 *     setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ## CSS + JS Animations Together
 *
 * AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,
 * defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore example below will only result in **JS animations taking
 * charge of the animation**:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-if="bool" class="slide">
 *   Slide in and out
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ```css
 * .slide.ng-enter {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transform:translateY(-100px);
 * }
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   transform:translateY(0);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can suppliment for the
 * lack of CSS animations by making use of the `$animateCss` service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from
 * our own JS-based animation code:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
*        // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.
 *       var runner = $animateCss(element, {
 *         event: 'enter',
 *         structural: true
 *       }).start();
*        runner.done(doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don't need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.
 *
 * The `$animateCss` service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or
 * keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that
 * data into `$animateCss` directly:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var runner = $animateCss(element, {
 *         event: 'enter',
 *         addClass: 'maroon-setting',
 *         from: { height:0 },
 *         to: { height: 200 }
 *       }).start();
 *
 *       runner.done(doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }
 *
 * /&#42; this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition
 * since the $animateCss code is adding the class &#42;/
 * .maroon-setting { background:red; }
 * ```
 *
 * And `$animateCss` will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the `done()` callback fire the `doneFn` function to signal when the animation is over.
 *
 * To learn more about what's possible be sure to visit the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss $animateCss service}.
 *
 * ## Animation Anchoring (via `ng-animate-ref`)
 *
 * ngAnimate in AngularJS 1.4 comes packed with the ability to cross-animate elements between
 * structural areas of an application (like views) by pairing up elements using an attribute
 * called `ng-animate-ref`.
 *
 * Let's say for example we have two views that are managed by `ng-view` and we want to show
 * that there is a relationship between two components situated in within these views. By using the
 * `ng-animate-ref` attribute we can identify that the two components are paired together and we
 * can then attach an animation, which is triggered when the view changes.
 *
 * Say for example we have the following template code:
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- index.html -->
 * <div ng-view class="view-animation">
 * </div>
 *
 * <!-- home.html -->
 * <a href="#/banner-page">
 *   <img src="./banner.jpg" class="banner" ng-animate-ref="banner">
 * </a>
 *
 * <!-- banner-page.html -->
 * <img src="./banner.jpg" class="banner" ng-animate-ref="banner">
 * ```
 *
 * Now, when the view changes (once the link is clicked), ngAnimate will examine the
 * HTML contents to see if there is a match reference between any components in the view
 * that is leaving and the view that is entering. It will scan both the view which is being
 * removed (leave) and inserted (enter) to see if there are any paired DOM elements that
 * contain a matching ref value.
 *
 * The two images match since they share the same ref value. ngAnimate will now create a
 * transport element (which is a clone of the first image element) and it will then attempt
 * to animate to the position of the second image element in the next view. For the animation to
 * work a special CSS class called `ng-anchor` will be added to the transported element.
 *
 * We can now attach a transition onto the `.banner.ng-anchor` CSS class and then
 * ngAnimate will handle the entire transition for us as well as the addition and removal of
 * any changes of CSS classes between the elements:
 *
 * ```css
 * .banner.ng-anchor {
 *   /&#42; this animation will last for 1 second since there are
 *          two phases to the animation (an `in` and an `out` phase) &#42;/
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We also **must** include animations for the views that are being entered and removed
 * (otherwise anchoring wouldn't be possible since the new view would be inserted right away).
 *
 * ```css
 * .view-animation.ng-enter, .view-animation.ng-leave {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   position:fixed;
 *   left:0;
 *   top:0;
 *   width:100%;
 * }
 * .view-animation.ng-enter {
 *   transform:translateX(100%);
 * }
 * .view-animation.ng-leave,
 * .view-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   transform:translateX(0%);
 * }
 * .view-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   transform:translateX(-100%);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can jump back to the anchor animation. When the animation happens, there are two stages that occur:
 * an `out` and an `in` stage. The `out` stage happens first and that is when the element is animated away
 * from its origin. Once that animation is over then the `in` stage occurs which animates the
 * element to its destination. The reason why there are two animations is to give enough time
 * for the enter animation on the new element to be ready.
 *
 * The example above sets up a transition for both the in and out phases, but we can also target the out or
 * in phases directly via `ng-anchor-out` and `ng-anchor-in`.
 *
 * ```css
 * .banner.ng-anchor-out {
 *   transition: 0.5s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; the scale will be applied during the out animation,
 *          but will be animated away when the in animation runs &#42;/
 *   transform: scale(1.2);
 * }
 *
 * .banner.ng-anchor-in {
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 *

 *
 * ### How is the element transported?
 *
 * When an anchor animation occurs, ngAnimate will clone the starting element and position it exactly where the starting
 * element is located on screen via absolute positioning. The cloned element will be placed inside of the root element
 * of the application (where ng-app was defined) and all of the CSS classes of the starting element will be applied. The
 * element will then animate into the `out` and `in` animations and will eventually reach the coordinates and match
 * the dimensions of the destination element. During the entire animation a CSS class of `.ng-animate-shim` will be applied
 * to both the starting and destination elements in order to hide them from being visible (the CSS styling for the class
 * is: `visibility:hidden`). Once the anchor reaches its destination then it will be removed and the destination element
 * will become visible since the shim class will be removed.
 *
 * ### How is the morphing handled?
 *
 * CSS Anchoring relies on transitions and keyframes and the internal code is intelligent enough to figure out
 * what CSS classes differ between the starting element and the destination element. These different CSS classes
 * will be added/removed on the anchor element and a transition will be applied (the transition that is provided
 * in the anchor class). Long story short, ngAnimate will figure out what classes to add and remove which will
 * make the transition of the element as smooth and automatic as possible. Be sure to use simple CSS classes that
 * do not rely on DOM nesting structure so that the anchor element appears the same as the starting element (since
 * the cloned element is placed inside of root element which is likely close to the body element).
 *
 * Note that if the root element is on the `<html>` element then the cloned node will be placed inside of body.
 *
 *
 * ## Using $animate in your directive code
 *
 * So far we've explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?
 * By injecting the `$animate` service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let's
 * imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes
 *
 * ```html
 * <greeting-box active="onOrOff">Hi there</greeting-box>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.directive('greetingBox', ['$animate', function($animate) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attrs) {
 *     attrs.$observe('active', function(value) {
 *       value ? $animate.addClass(element, 'on') ? $animate.removeClass(element, 'on');
 *     });
 *   });
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Now the `on` CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element
 * in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element &#42;/
 * [greeting-box].on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }
 * ```
 *
 * The `$animate` service contains a variety of other methods like `enter`, `leave`, `animate` and `setClass`. To learn more about what's
 * possible be sure to visit the {@link ng.$animate $animate service API page}.
 *
 *
 * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries
 *
 * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
 * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
 * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.
 *
 * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/
 * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:
 *
 * ```js
 * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
 * ```
 *
 * This also may provide your application with a speed boost since only specific elements containing CSS class prefix
 * will be evaluated for animation when any DOM changes occur in the application.
 *
 * ## Callbacks and Promises
 *
 * When `$animate` is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger
 * an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has
 * ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.
 *
 * ```js
 * // somewhere within the depths of the directive
 * $animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {
 *   //the animation has completed
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using `$scope.$apply(...)`. This is not the case
 * anymore.)
 *
 * In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering
 * an event listener using the `$animate` service. Let's say for example that an animation was triggered on our view
 * routing controller to hook into that:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.controller('HomePageController', ['$animate', function($animate) {
 *   $animate.on('enter', ngViewElement, function(element) {
 *     // the animation for this route has completed
 *   }]);
 * }])
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that you will need to trigger a digest within the callback to get angular to notice any scope-related changes.)

   *    `$location.path` will be updated to add or drop the trailing slash to exactly match the
   *    route definition.
   *
   *    * `path` can contain named groups starting with a colon: e.g. `:name`. All characters up
   *        to the next slash are matched and stored in `$routeParams` under the given `name`

   *      controller} if passed as a string.
   *    - `controllerAs` – `{string=}` – An identifier name for a reference to the controller.
   *      If present, the controller will be published to scope under the `controllerAs` name.
   *    - `template` – `{string=|function()=}` – html template as a string or a function that
   *      returns an html template as a string which should be used by {@link
   *      ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView} or {@link ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude} directives.
   *      This property takes precedence over `templateUrl`.
   *
   *      If `template` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route
   *
   *    - `templateUrl` – `{string=|function()=}` – path or function that returns a path to an html
   *      template that should be used by {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}.
   *
   *      If `templateUrl` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route
   *
   *    - `resolve` - `{Object.<string, function>=}` - An optional map of dependencies which should
   *      be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, the router
   *      will wait for them all to be resolved or one to be rejected before the controller is
   *      instantiated.
   *      If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values of the resolved promises are
   *      injected and {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeSuccess $routeChangeSuccess} event is
   *      fired. If any of the promises are rejected the
   *      {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeError $routeChangeError} event is fired. The map object
   *      is:
   *
   *      - `key` – `{string}`: a name of a dependency to be injected into the controller.
   *      - `factory` - `{string|function}`: If `string` then it is an alias for a service.
   *        Otherwise if function, then it is {@link auto.$injector#invoke injected}
   *        and the return value is treated as the dependency. If the result is a promise, it is
   *        resolved before its value is injected into the controller. Be aware that
   *        `ngRoute.$routeParams` will still refer to the previous route within these resolve
   *        functions.  Use `$route.current.params` to access the new route parameters, instead.
   *
   *    - `redirectTo` – {(string|function())=} – value to update
   *      {@link ng.$location $location} path with and trigger route redirection.

   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route templateUrl.
   *      - `{string}` - current `$location.path()`
   *      - `{Object}` - current `$location.search()`
   *
   *      The custom `redirectTo` function is expected to return a string which will be used
   *      to update `$location.path()` and `$location.search()`.
   *
   *    - `[reloadOnSearch=true]` - {boolean=} - reload route when only `$location.search()`
   *      or `$location.hash()` changes.
   *
   *      If the option is set to `false` and url in the browser changes, then

     * @description
     * `$route` is used for deep-linking URLs to controllers and views (HTML partials).
     * It watches `$location.url()` and tries to map the path to an existing route definition.
     *
     * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.
     *
     * You can define routes through {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider}'s API.
     *
     * The `$route` service is typically used in conjunction with the
     * {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView `ngView`} directive and the
     * {@link ngRoute.$routeParams `$routeParams`} service.
     *
     * @example
     * This example shows how changing the URL hash causes the `$route` to match a route against the
     * URL, and the `ngView` pulls in the partial.

 *
 * The route parameters are a combination of {@link ng.$location `$location`}'s
 * {@link ng.$location#search `search()`} and {@link ng.$location#path `path()`}.
 * The `path` parameters are extracted when the {@link ngRoute.$route `$route`} path is matched.

 *
 * The service guarantees that the identity of the `$routeParams` object will remain unchanged
 * (but its properties will likely change) even when a route change occurs.
 *
 * Note that the `$routeParams` are only updated *after* a route change completes successfully.
 * This means that you cannot rely on `$routeParams` being correct in route resolve functions.
 * Instead you can use `$route.current.params` to access the new route's parameters.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 *  // Given:

 *  // Route: /Chapter/:chapterId/Section/:sectionId

 * @scope
 * @priority 400
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll Whether `ngView` should call {@link ng.$anchorScroll

 *                  - If the attribute is not set, disable scrolling.
 *                  - If the attribute is set without value, enable scrolling.
 *                  - Otherwise enable scrolling only if the `autoscroll` attribute value evaluated

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngApp
 * @module ng
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {angular.Module} ngApp an optional application
 *   {@link angular.module module} name to load.
 * @param {boolean=} ngStrictDi if this attribute is present on the app element, the injector will be
 *   created in "strict-di" mode. This means that the application will fail to invoke functions which
 *   do not use explicit function annotation (and are thus unsuitable for minification), as described
 *   in {@link guide/di the Dependency Injection guide}, and useful debugging info will assist in
 *   tracking down the root of these bugs.
 *
 * @description
 *
 * Use this directive to **auto-bootstrap** an AngularJS application. The `ngApp` directive
 * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element
 * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.
 *
 * Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`
 * found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an
 * application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using
 * {@link angular.bootstrap} instead. AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
 *
 * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This
 * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped. It
 * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will
 * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.
 *
 * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the
 * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`
 * would not be resolved to `3`.
 *
 * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common way to bootstrap an application.
 *
 <example module="ngAppDemo">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-controller="ngAppDemoController">
     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}
   </div>
   </file>
   <file name="script.js">
   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {
     $scope.a = 1;
     $scope.b = 2;
   });
   </file>
 </example>
 *
 * Using `ngStrictDi`, you would see something like this:
 *
 <example ng-app-included="true">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-app="ngAppStrictDemo" ng-strict-di>
       <div ng-controller="GoodController1">
           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see
              script.js for details)
           </p>
       </div>

       <div ng-controller="GoodController2">
           Name: <input ng-model="name"><br />
           Hello, {{name}}!

           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style
              (see script.js for details)
           </p>
       </div>

       <div ng-controller="BadController">
           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

           <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying
              on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in
              strict mode). As such, the content of this section is not
              interpolated, and there should be an error in your web console.

     * The `angular.module` is a global place for creating, registering and retrieving Angular
     * modules.
     * All modules (angular core or 3rd party) that should be available to an application must be
     * registered using this mechanism.
     *

     *
     * # Module
     *
     * A module is a collection of services, directives, controllers, filters, and configuration information.
     * `angular.module` is used to configure the {@link auto.$injector $injector}.
     *
     * ```js
     * // Create a new module
     * var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);
     *
     * // register a new service
     * myModule.value('appName', 'MyCoolApp');
     *
     * // configure existing services inside initialization blocks.
     * myModule.config(['$locationProvider', function($locationProvider) {
     *   // Configure existing providers
     *   $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
     * }]);
     * ```
     *
     * Then you can create an injector and load your modules like this:
     *
     * ```js
     * var injector = angular.injector(['ng', 'myModule'])
     * ```
     *
     * However it's more likely that you'll just use
     * {@link ng.directive:ngApp ngApp} or
     * {@link angular.bootstrap} to simplify this process for you.

/**
 * @ngdoc function
 * @name angular.element
 * @module ng
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.
 *
 * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the
 * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`
 * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called "jQuery lite" or "jqLite."
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows
 * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. **jqLite** implements only the most
 * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.</div>
 *
 * To use `jQuery`, simply ensure it is loaded before the `angular.js` file.
 *
 * <div class="alert">**Note:** all element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or
 * jqLite; they are never raw DOM references.</div>
 *
 * ## Angular's jqLite
 * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:
 *
 * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/)
 * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)
 * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)
 * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/) - Does not support functions as parameters
 * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)
 * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)
 * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call `getComputedStyle()`. As a setter, does not convert numbers to strings or append 'px'.
 * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)
 * - [`detach()`](http://api.jquery.com/detach/)
 * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)
 * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)
 * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name
 * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)
 * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)
 * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors
 * - [`one()`](http://api.jquery.com/one/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors
 * - [`parent()`](http://api.jquery.com/parent/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`prepend()`](http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)
 * - [`prop()`](http://api.jquery.com/prop/)
 * - [`ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)
 * - [`remove()`](http://api.jquery.com/remove/)
 * - [`removeAttr()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/)
 * - [`removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/)
 * - [`removeData()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeData/)
 * - [`replaceWith()`](http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/)
 * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)
 * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/)
 * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers.
 * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) - Does not support namespaces
 * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)
 * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)
 *
 * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras
 * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:
 *
 * ### Events
 * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event
 *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM
 *    element before it is removed.
 *
 * ### Methods
 * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default
 *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as
 *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.
 *   `'ngModel'`).
 * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.
 * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current
 *   element or its parent. Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to
 *   be enabled.
 * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the
 *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate
 *   scope. Calling `scope()` on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope.
 *   Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to be enabled.
 * - `inheritedData()` - same as `data()`, but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top
 *   parent element is reached.
 *
 * @param {string|DOMElement} element HTML string or DOMElement to be wrapped into jQuery.
 * @returns {Object} jQuery object.

 * Creates an injector object that can be used for retrieving services as well as for
 * dependency injection (see {@link guide/di dependency injection}).
 *
 * @param {Array.<string|Function>} modules A list of module functions or their aliases. See
 *     {@link angular.module}. The `ng` module must be explicitly added.
 * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Whether the injector should be in strict mode, which

 * @returns {injector} Injector object. See {@link auto.$injector $injector}.
 *
 * @example
 * Typical usage
 * ```js
 *   // create an injector
 *   var $injector = angular.injector(['ng']);
 *
 *   // use the injector to kick off your application
 *   // use the type inference to auto inject arguments, or use implicit injection
 *   $injector.invoke(function($rootScope, $compile, $document) {
 *     $compile($document)($rootScope);
 *     $rootScope.$digest();
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Sometimes you want to get access to the injector of a currently running Angular app
 * from outside Angular. Perhaps, you want to inject and compile some markup after the
 * application has been bootstrapped. You can do this using the extra `injector()` added
 * to JQuery/jqLite elements. See {@link angular.element}.
 *
 * *This is fairly rare but could be the case if a third party library is injecting the
 * markup.*
 *
 * In the following example a new block of HTML containing a `ng-controller`
 * directive is added to the end of the document body by JQuery. We then compile and link
 * it into the current AngularJS scope.
 *
 * ```js
 * var $div = $('<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">{{content.label}}</div>');
 * $(document.body).append($div);
 *
 * angular.element(document).injector().invoke(function($compile) {
 *   var scope = angular.element($div).scope();

 * # Injection Function Annotation
 *
 * JavaScript does not have annotations, and annotations are needed for dependency injection. The
 * following are all valid ways of annotating function with injection arguments and are equivalent.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // inferred (only works if code not minified/obfuscated)
 *   $injector.invoke(function(serviceA){});
 *
 *   // annotated
 *   function explicit(serviceA) {};
 *   explicit.$inject = ['serviceA'];
 *   $injector.invoke(explicit);
 *
 *   // inline
 *   $injector.invoke(['serviceA', function(serviceA){}]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Inference
 *
 * In JavaScript calling `toString()` on a function returns the function definition. The definition
 * can then be parsed and the function arguments can be extracted. This method of discovering
 * annotations is disallowed when the injector is in strict mode.
 * *NOTE:* This does not work with minification, and obfuscation tools since these tools change the
 * argument names.
 *
 * ## `$inject` Annotation
 * By adding an `$inject` property onto a function the injection parameters can be specified.
 *
 * ## Inline

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $injector#annotate
 *
 * @description
 * Returns an array of service names which the function is requesting for injection. This API is
 * used by the injector to determine which services need to be injected into the function when the
 * function is invoked. There are three ways in which the function can be annotated with the needed
 * dependencies.
 *
 * # Argument names
 *
 * The simplest form is to extract the dependencies from the arguments of the function. This is done
 * by converting the function into a string using `toString()` method and extracting the argument
 * names.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   function MyController($scope, $route) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * You can disallow this method by using strict injection mode.
 *
 * This method does not work with code minification / obfuscation. For this reason the following
 * annotation strategies are supported.
 *
 * # The `$inject` property
 *
 * If a function has an `$inject` property and its value is an array of strings, then the strings
 * represent names of services to be injected into the function.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   var MyController = function(obfuscatedScope, obfuscatedRoute) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *   // Define function dependencies
 *   MyController['$inject'] = ['$scope', '$route'];
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * # The array notation
 *
 * It is often desirable to inline Injected functions and that's when setting the `$inject` property
 * is very inconvenient. In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in
 * a way that survives minification is a better choice:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // We wish to write this (not minification / obfuscation safe)
 *   injector.invoke(function($compile, $rootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   });
 *
 *   // We are forced to write break inlining
 *   var tmpFn = function(obfuscatedCompile, obfuscatedRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   };
 *   tmpFn.$inject = ['$compile', '$rootScope'];
 *   injector.invoke(tmpFn);
 *
 *   // To better support inline function the inline annotation is supported
 *   injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   }]);
 *
 *   // Therefore
 *   expect(injector.annotate(
 *      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])
 *    ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} fn Function for which dependent service names need to
 * be retrieved as described above.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Disallow argument name annotation inference.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $provide
 *
 * @description
 *
 * The {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has a number of methods for registering components
 * with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Many of these functions are also exposed on
 * {@link angular.Module}.
 *
 * An Angular **service** is a singleton object created by a **service factory**.  These **service
 * factories** are functions which, in turn, are created by a **service provider**.
 * The **service providers** are constructor functions. When instantiated they must contain a
 * property called `$get`, which holds the **service factory** function.
 *
 * When you request a service, the {@link auto.$injector $injector} is responsible for finding the
 * correct **service provider**, instantiating it and then calling its `$get` **service factory**
 * function to get the instance of the **service**.
 *
 * Often services have no configuration options and there is no need to add methods to the service
 * provider.  The provider will be no more than a constructor function with a `$get` property. For
 * these cases the {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has additional helper methods to register

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $provide#provider
 * @description
 *
 * Register a **provider function** with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Provider functions
 * are constructor functions, whose instances are responsible for "providing" a factory for a
 * service.
 *
 * Service provider names start with the name of the service they provide followed by `Provider`.
 * For example, the {@link ng.$log $log} service has a provider called
 * {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider}.
 *
 * Service provider objects can have additional methods which allow configuration of the provider
 * and its service. Importantly, you can configure what kind of service is created by the `$get`
 * method, or how that service will act. For example, the {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider} has a
 * method {@link ng.$logProvider#debugEnabled debugEnabled}
 * which lets you specify whether the {@link ng.$log $log} service will log debug messages to the
 * console or not.
 *
 * @param {string} name The name of the instance. NOTE: the provider will be available under `name +
                        'Provider'` key.
 * @param {(Object|function())} provider If the provider is:
 *
 *   - `Object`: then it should have a `$get` method. The `$get` method will be invoked using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#invoke $injector.invoke()} when an instance needs to be created.
 *   - `Constructor`: a new instance of the provider will be created using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#instantiate $injector.instantiate()}, then treated as `object`.
 *
 * @returns {Object} registered provider instance

 * @example
 *
 * The following example shows how to create a simple event tracking service and register it using
 * {@link auto.$provide#provider $provide.provider()}.
 *
 * ```js
 *  // Define the eventTracker provider
 *  function EventTrackerProvider() {
 *    var trackingUrl = '/track';
 *
 *    // A provider method for configuring where the tracked events should been saved
 *    this.setTrackingUrl = function(url) {
 *      trackingUrl = url;
 *    };
 *
 *    // The service factory function
 *    this.$get = ['$http', function($http) {
 *      var trackedEvents = {};
 *      return {
 *        // Call this to track an event
 *        event: function(event) {
 *          var count = trackedEvents[event] || 0;
 *          count += 1;
 *          trackedEvents[event] = count;
 *          return count;
 *        },
 *        // Call this to save the tracked events to the trackingUrl
 *        save: function() {
 *          $http.post(trackingUrl, trackedEvents);
 *        }
 *      };
 *    }];
 *  }
 *
 *  describe('eventTracker', function() {
 *    var postSpy;
 *
 *    beforeEach(module(function($provide) {
 *      // Register the eventTracker provider
 *      $provide.provider('eventTracker', EventTrackerProvider);
 *    }));
 *
 *    beforeEach(module(function(eventTrackerProvider) {
 *      // Configure eventTracker provider
 *      eventTrackerProvider.setTrackingUrl('/custom-track');
 *    }));
 *
 *    it('tracks events', inject(function(eventTracker) {
 *      expect(eventTracker.event('login')).toEqual(1);
 *      expect(eventTracker.event('login')).toEqual(2);
 *    }));
 *
 *    it('saves to the tracking url', inject(function(eventTracker, $http) {
 *      postSpy = spyOn($http, 'post');
 *      eventTracker.event('login');
 *      eventTracker.save();
 *      expect(postSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
 *      expect(postSpy.mostRecentCall.args[0]).not.toEqual('/track');
 *      expect(postSpy.mostRecentCall.args[0]).toEqual('/custom-track');

 *
 * @param {string} name The name of the service to decorate.
 * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} decorator This function will be invoked when the service needs to be

 *    Local injection arguments:

 *    * `$delegate` - The original service instance, which can be monkey patched, configured,

   * - **jqLite**: A jqLite/jQuery element to be used for specifying the offset. The distance from
   *   the top of the page to the element's bottom will be used as offset.<br />
   *   **Note**: The element will be taken into account only as long as its `position` is set to

 * The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to

 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** This document is an in-depth reference of all directive options.
 * For a gentle introduction to directives with examples of common use cases,
 * see the {@link guide/directive directive guide}.
 * </div>
 *
 * ## Comprehensive Directive API
 *
 * There are many different options for a directive.
 *
 * The difference resides in the return value of the factory function.
 * You can either return a "Directive Definition Object" (see below) that defines the directive properties,
 * or just the `postLink` function (all other properties will have the default values).
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's recommended to use the "directive definition object" form.
 * </div>
 *
 * Here's an example directive declared with a Directive Definition Object:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       priority: 0,
 *       template: '<div></div>', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       // or
 *       // templateUrl: 'directive.html', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       transclude: false,
 *       restrict: 'A',
 *       templateNamespace: 'html',
 *       scope: false,
 *       controller: function($scope, $element, $attrs, $transclude, otherInjectables) { ... },
 *       controllerAs: 'stringIdentifier',
 *       bindToController: false,
 *       require: 'siblingDirectiveName', // or // ['^parentDirectiveName', '?optionalDirectiveName', '?^optionalParent'],
 *       compile: function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) {
 *         return {
 *           pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *           post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *         }
 *         // or
 *         // return function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *       },
 *       // or
 *       // link: {
 *       //  pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *       //  post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *       // }
 *       // or
 *       // link: function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Any unspecified options will use the default value. You can see the default values below.
 * </div>
 *
 * Therefore the above can be simplified as:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *     // or
 *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Directive Definition Object
 *
 * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile
 * compiler}. The attributes are:
 *
 * #### `multiElement`
 * When this property is set to true, the HTML compiler will collect DOM nodes between
 * nodes with the attributes `directive-name-start` and `directive-name-end`, and group them
 * together as the directive elements. It is recommended that this feature be used on directives
 * which are not strictly behavioural (such as {@link ngClick}), and which
 * do not manipulate or replace child nodes (such as {@link ngInclude}).
 *
 * #### `priority`
 * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it
 * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used
 * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a
 * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions
 * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order
 * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.
 *
 * #### `terminal`
 * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives
 * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute
 * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined). Note that expressions
 * and other directives used in the directive's template will also be excluded from execution.
 *
 * #### `scope`
 * **If set to `true`,** then a new scope will be created for this directive. If multiple directives on the
 * same element request a new scope, only one new scope is created. The new scope rule does not
 * apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scope.
 *
 * **If set to `{}` (object hash),** then a new "isolate" scope is created. The 'isolate' scope differs from
 * normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope. This is useful
 * when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify data in the
 * parent scope.
 *
 * The 'isolate' scope takes an object hash which defines a set of local scope properties
 * derived from the parent scope. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for
 * templates. Locals definition is a hash of local scope property to its source:
 *
 * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is
 *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified  then the
 *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<widget my-attr="hello {{name}}">` and widget definition
 *   of `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localName` will reflect
 *   the interpolated value of `hello {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the
 *   `localName` property on the widget scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not
 *   component scope).
 *
 * * `=` or `=attr` - set up bi-directional binding between a local scope property and the
 *   parent scope property of name defined via the value of the `attr` attribute. If no `attr`
 *   name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<widget my-attr="parentModel">` and widget definition of
 *   `scope: { localModel:'=myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localModel` will reflect the
 *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected
 *   in `localModel` and any changes in `localModel` will reflect in `parentModel`. If the parent
 *   scope property doesn't exist, it will throw a NON_ASSIGNABLE_MODEL_EXPRESSION exception. You
 *   can avoid this behavior using `=?` or `=?attr` in order to flag the property as optional. If
 *   you want to shallow watch for changes (i.e. $watchCollection instead of $watch) you can use
 *   `=*` or `=*attr` (`=*?` or `=*?attr` if the property is optional).
 *
 * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope.
 *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the
 *   local name. Given `<widget my-attr="count = count + value">` and widget definition of
 *   `scope: { localFn:'&myAttr' }`, then isolate scope property `localFn` will point to
 *   a function wrapper for the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to
 *   pass data from the isolated scope via an expression to the parent scope, this can be
 *   done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper fn.
 *   For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)` then we can specify the amount value
 *   by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.
 *
 *
 * #### `bindToController`
 * When an isolate scope is used for a component (see above), and `controllerAs` is used, `bindToController: true` will
 * allow a component to have its properties bound to the controller, rather than to scope. When the controller
 * is instantiated, the initial values of the isolate scope bindings are already available.
 *
 * #### `controller`
 * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the
 * pre-linking phase and it is shared with other directives (see
 * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment
 * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:
 *
 * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element
 * * `$element` - Current element
 * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element
 * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope:
 *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.
 *    * `scope`: optional argument to override the scope.
 *    * `cloneLinkingFn`: optional argument to create clones of the original transcluded content.
 *    * `futureParentElement`:
 *        * defines the parent to which the `cloneLinkingFn` will add the cloned elements.
 *        * default: `$element.parent()` resp. `$element` for `transclude:'element'` resp. `transclude:true`.
 *        * only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html elements (e.g. SVG elements)
 *          and when the `cloneLinkinFn` is passed,
 *          as those elements need to created and cloned in a special way when they are defined outside their
 *          usual containers (e.g. like `<svg>`).
 *        * See also the `directive.templateNamespace` property.
 *
 *
 * #### `require`
 * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The
 * `require` takes a string name (or array of strings) of the directive(s) to pass in. If an array is used, the
 * injected argument will be an array in corresponding order. If no such directive can be
 * found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is raised (unless no link function
 * is specified, in which case error checking is skipped). The name can be prefixed with:
 *
 * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `^^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass
 *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `?^^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents, or pass
 *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 *
 *
 * #### `controllerAs`
 * Identifier name for a reference to the controller in the directive's scope.
 * This allows the controller to be referenced from the directive template. The directive
 * needs to define a scope for this configuration to be used. Useful in the case when
 * directive is used as component.
 *
 *
 * #### `restrict`
 * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive
 * declaration style. If omitted, the defaults (elements and attributes) are used.
 *
 * * `E` - Element name (default): `<my-directive></my-directive>`
 * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive="exp"></div>`
 * * `C` - Class: `<div class="my-directive: exp;"></div>`
 * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`
 *
 *
 * #### `templateNamespace`
 * String representing the document type used by the markup in the template.
 * AngularJS needs this information as those elements need to be created and cloned
 * in a special way when they are defined outside their usual containers like `<svg>` and `<math>`.
 *
 * * `html` - All root nodes in the template are HTML. Root nodes may also be
 *   top-level elements such as `<svg>` or `<math>`.
 * * `svg` - The root nodes in the template are SVG elements (excluding `<math>`).
 * * `math` - The root nodes in the template are MathML elements (excluding `<svg>`).
 *
 * If no `templateNamespace` is specified, then the namespace is considered to be `html`.
 *
 * #### `template`
 * HTML markup that may:
 * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).
 * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).
 * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).
 *
 * Value may be:
 *
 * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.
 * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`
 *   function api below) and returns a string value.
 *
 *
 * #### `templateUrl`
 * This is similar to `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL, asynchronously.
 *
 * Because template loading is asynchronous the compiler will suspend compilation of directives on that element
 * for later when the template has been resolved.  In the meantime it will continue to compile and link
 * sibling and parent elements as though this element had not contained any directives.
 *
 * The compiler does not suspend the entire compilation to wait for templates to be loaded because this
 * would result in the whole app "stalling" until all templates are loaded asynchronously - even in the
 * case when only one deeply nested directive has `templateUrl`.
 *
 * Template loading is asynchronous even if the template has been preloaded into the {@link $templateCache}
 *
 * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two
 * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns
 * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link
 * $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.
 *
 *
 * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release - i.e. v2.0)
 * specify what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.
 * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.
 *
 * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new
 * one. See the {@link guide/directive#template-expanding-directive
 * Directives Guide} for an example.
 *
 * There are very few scenarios where element replacement is required for the application function,
 * the main one being reusable custom components that are used within SVG contexts
 * (because SVG doesn't work with custom elements in the DOM tree).
 *
 * #### `transclude`
 * Extract the contents of the element where the directive appears and make it available to the directive.
 * The contents are compiled and provided to the directive as a **transclusion function**. See the
 * {@link $compile#transclusion Transclusion} section below.
 *
 * There are two kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the
 * directive's element or the entire element:
 *
 * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.
 * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this
 *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`
 *   property is ignored.
 *
 *
 * #### `compile`
 *
 * ```js
 *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do
 * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:
 *
 *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is
 *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.
 *
 *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive compile functions.
 *
 *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has
 * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that
 * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration
 * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.
 * </div>

 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their
 * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and a
 * stack overflow errors.
 *
 * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile
 * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or
 * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.
 * </div>
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-danger">
 * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it
 *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed
 *   to the link function instead.
 * </div>

 * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.
 *
 * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the
 *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.
 *
 * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to
 *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about
 *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.
 *
 *
 * #### `link`
 * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.
 *
 * ```js
 *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is
 * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be
 * put.
 *
 *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the
 *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.
 *
 *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to
 *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have
 *     already been linked.
 *
 *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive linking functions.
 *
 *   * `controller` - the directive's required controller instance(s) - Instances are shared
 *     among all directives, which allows the directives to use the controllers as a communication
 *     channel. The exact value depends on the directive's `require` property:
 *       * `string`: the controller instance
 *       * `array`: array of controller instances
 *       * no controller(s) required: `undefined`
 *
 *     If a required controller cannot be found, and it is optional, the instance is `null`,
 *     otherwise the {@link error:$compile:ctreq Missing Required Controller} error is thrown.
 *
 *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.
 *     This is the same as the `$transclude`
 *     parameter of directive controllers, see there for details.
 *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.
 *
 * #### Pre-linking function
 *
 * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the
 * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.
 *
 * #### Post-linking function
 *
 * Executed after the child elements are linked.
 *
 * Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled
 * and linked since they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own
 * compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs.
 *
 * It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function on elements that are not waiting
 * for their async templates to be resolved.
 *
 *
 * ### Transclusion
 *
 * Transclusion is the process of extracting a collection of DOM element from one part of the DOM and
 * copying them to another part of the DOM, while maintaining their connection to the original AngularJS
 * scope from where they were taken.
 *
 * Transclusion is used (often with {@link ngTransclude}) to insert the
 * original contents of a directive's element into a specified place in the template of the directive.
 * The benefit of transclusion, over simply moving the DOM elements manually, is that the transcluded
 * content has access to the properties on the scope from which it was taken, even if the directive
 * has isolated scope.
 * See the {@link guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements Directives Guide}.
 *
 * This makes it possible for the widget to have private state for its template, while the transcluded
 * content has access to its originating scope.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the
 * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives
 * Testing Transclusion Directives}.
 * </div>
 *
 * #### Transclusion Functions
 *
 * When a directive requests transclusion, the compiler extracts its contents and provides a **transclusion
 * function** to the directive's `link` function and `controller`. This transclusion function is a special
 * **linking function** that will return the compiled contents linked to a new transclusion scope.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * If you are just using {@link ngTransclude} then you don't need to worry about this function, since
 * ngTransclude will deal with it for us.
 * </div>
 *
 * If you want to manually control the insertion and removal of the transcluded content in your directive
 * then you must use this transclude function. When you call a transclude function it returns a a jqLite/JQuery
 * object that contains the compiled DOM, which is linked to the correct transclusion scope.
 *
 * When you call a transclusion function you can pass in a **clone attach function**. This function accepts
 * two parameters, `function(clone, scope) { ... }`, where the `clone` is a fresh compiled copy of your transcluded
 * content and the `scope` is the newly created transclusion scope, to which the clone is bound.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Best Practice**: Always provide a `cloneFn` (clone attach function) when you call a translude function
 * since you then get a fresh clone of the original DOM and also have access to the new transclusion scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * It is normal practice to attach your transcluded content (`clone`) to the DOM inside your **clone
 * attach function**:
 *
 * ```js
 * var transcludedContent, transclusionScope;
 *
 * $transclude(function(clone, scope) {
 *   element.append(clone);
 *   transcludedContent = clone;
 *   transclusionScope = scope;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Later, if you want to remove the transcluded content from your DOM then you should also destroy the
 * associated transclusion scope:
 *
 * ```js
 * transcludedContent.remove();
 * transclusionScope.$destroy();
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Best Practice**: if you intend to add and remove transcluded content manually in your directive
 * (by calling the transclude function to get the DOM and calling `element.remove()` to remove it),
 * then you are also responsible for calling `$destroy` on the transclusion scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * The built-in DOM manipulation directives, such as {@link ngIf}, {@link ngSwitch} and {@link ngRepeat}
 * automatically destroy their transluded clones as necessary so you do not need to worry about this if
 * you are simply using {@link ngTransclude} to inject the transclusion into your directive.
 *
 *
 * #### Transclusion Scopes
 *
 * When you call a transclude function it returns a DOM fragment that is pre-bound to a **transclusion
 * scope**. This scope is special, in that it is a child of the directive's scope (and so gets destroyed
 * when the directive's scope gets destroyed) but it inherits the properties of the scope from which it
 * was taken.
 *
 * For example consider a directive that uses transclusion and isolated scope. The DOM hierarchy might look
 * like this:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-app>
 *   <div isolate>
 *     <div transclusion>
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The `$parent` scope hierarchy will look like this:
 *
 * ```
 * - $rootScope
 *   - isolate
 *     - transclusion
 * ```
 *
 * but the scopes will inherit prototypically from different scopes to their `$parent`.
 *
 * ```
 * - $rootScope
 *   - transclusion
 * - isolate
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ### Attributes
 *
 * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the
 * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.
 *
 * accessing *Normalized attribute names:*
 * Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways: 'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'.
 * the attributes object allows for normalized access to
 *   the attributes.
 *
 * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes
 *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive
 *   communication.
 *
 * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object
 *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.
 *
 * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes
 *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src="{{bar}}"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also
 *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation
 *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.
 *
 * ```js
 * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
 *   // get the attribute value
 *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);
 *
 *   // change the attribute
 *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');
 *
 *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute
 *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {
 *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`. The example below is
 * to illustrate how `$compile` works.
 * </div>
 *
 <example module="compileExample">
   <file name="index.html">
    <script>
      angular.module('compileExample', [], function($compileProvider) {
        // configure new 'compile' directive by passing a directive
        // factory function. The factory function injects the '$compile'
        $compileProvider.directive('compile', function($compile) {
          // directive factory creates a link function
          return function(scope, element, attrs) {
            scope.$watch(
              function(scope) {
                 // watch the 'compile' expression for changes
                return scope.$eval(attrs.compile);
              },
              function(value) {
                // when the 'compile' expression changes
                // assign it into the current DOM
                element.html(value);

                // compile the new DOM and link it to the current
                // scope.
                // NOTE: we only compile .childNodes so that
                // we don't get into infinite loop compiling ourselves
                $compile(element.contents())(scope);
              }
            );
          };
        });
      })
      .controller('GreeterController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = 'Angular';
        $scope.html = 'Hello {{name}}';
      }]);
    </script>
    <div ng-controller="GreeterController">
      <input ng-model="name"> <br/>
      <textarea ng-model="html"></textarea> <br/>
      <div compile="html"></div>

 * @param {function(angular.Scope, cloneAttachFn=)} transclude function available to directives - DEPRECATED.

 * **Note:** Passing a `transclude` function to the $compile function is deprecated, as it
 *   e.g. will not use the right outer scope. Please pass the transclude function as a
 *   `parentBoundTranscludeFn` to the link function instead.
 * </div>
 *
 * @param {number} maxPriority only apply directives lower than given priority (Only effects the
 *                 root element(s), not their children)
 * @returns {function(scope, cloneAttachFn=, options=)} a link function which is used to bind template
 * (a DOM element/tree) to a scope. Where:
 *
 *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.
 *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the
 *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the
 *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is
 *  called as: <br/> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:
 *
 *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.
 *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.
 *
 *  * `options` - An optional object hash with linking options. If `options` is provided, then the following
 *  keys may be used to control linking behavior:
 *
 *      * `parentBoundTranscludeFn` - the transclude function made available to
 *        directives; if given, it will be passed through to the link functions of
 *        directives found in `element` during compilation.
 *      * `transcludeControllers` - an object hash with keys that map controller names
 *        to controller instances; if given, it will make the controllers
 *        available to directives.
 *      * `futureParentElement` - defines the parent to which the `cloneAttachFn` will add
 *        the cloned elements; only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html
 *        elements (e.g. SVG elements). See also the directive.controller property.
 *
 * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original
 * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.
 *
 * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by
 * Angular automatically.
 *
 * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:
 *
 * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)
 *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.
 *   ```js
 *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);
 *   ```
 *
 * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original
 *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In
 *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:
 *   ```js
 *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),
 *         scope = ....;
 *
 *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {
 *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place
 *     });
 *
 *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`
 *   ```
 *
 *
 * For information on how the compiler works, see the
 * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.

 * Any uncaught exception in angular expressions is delegated to this service.

 * the browser console.
 *
 * In unit tests, if `angular-mocks.js` is loaded, this service is overridden by
 * {@link ngMock.$exceptionHandler mock $exceptionHandler} which aids in testing.
 *
 * ## Example:
 *
 * ```js
 *   angular.module('exceptionOverride', []).factory('$exceptionHandler', function() {
 *     return function(exception, cause) {
 *       exception.message += ' (caused by "' + cause + '")';

 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * This example will override the normal action of `$exceptionHandler`, to make angular
 * exceptions fail hard when they happen, instead of just logging to the console.
 *
 * <hr />
 * Note, that code executed in event-listeners (even those registered using jqLite's `on`/`bind`
 * methods) does not delegate exceptions to the {@link ng.$exceptionHandler $exceptionHandler}
 * (unless executed during a digest).
 *
 * If you wish, you can manually delegate exceptions, e.g.
 * `try { ... } catch(e) { $exceptionHandler(e); }`
 *
 * @param {Error} exception Exception associated with the error.
 * @param {string=} cause optional information about the context in which

     * @description
     * The `$http` service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote
     * HTTP servers via the browser's [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest)
     * object or via [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP).
     *
     * For unit testing applications that use `$http` service, see
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend $httpBackend mock}.
     *
     * For a higher level of abstraction, please check out the {@link ngResource.$resource
     * $resource} service.
     *
     * The $http API is based on the {@link ng.$q deferred/promise APIs} exposed by
     * the $q service. While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage
     * it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.
     *
     *
     * ## General usage
     * The `$http` service is a function which takes a single argument — a configuration object —
     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}
     * with two $http specific methods: `success` and `error`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   // Simple GET request example :
     *   $http.get('/someUrl').
     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }).
     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     * ```js
     *   // Simple POST request example (passing data) :
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', {msg:'hello word!'}).
     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }).
     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Since the returned value of calling the $http function is a `promise`, you can also use
     * the `then` method to register callbacks, and these callbacks will receive a single argument –
     * an object representing the response. See the API signature and type info below for more
     * details.
     *
     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and
     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,
     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be
     * called for such responses.
     *
     * ## Writing Unit Tests that use $http
     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending
     * request using trained responses.
     *
     * ```
     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);
     * $http.get(...);
     * $httpBackend.flush();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Shortcut methods
     *
     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and
     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);
     * ```
     *
     * Complete list of shortcut methods:
     *
     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}
     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}
     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}
     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}
     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}
     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}
     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}
     *
     *
     * ## Setting HTTP Headers
     *
     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults
     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration
     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:
     *
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):
     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     *
     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration
     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object
     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }`.
     *
     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same
     * fashion. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * module.run(function($http) {
     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when
     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.
     *
     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,
     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:
     *
     * ```js
     * var req = {
     *  method: 'POST',
     *  url: 'http://example.com',
     *  headers: {
     *    'Content-Type': undefined
     *  },
     *  data: { test: 'test' }
     * }
     *
     * $http(req).success(function(){...}).error(function(){...});
     * ```
     *
     * ## Transforming Requests and Responses
     *
     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transformation functions: `transformRequest`
     * and `transformResponse`. These properties can be a single function that returns
     * the transformed value (`function(data, headersGetter, status)`) or an array of such transformation functions,
     * which allows you to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain.
     *
     * ### Default Transformations
     *
     * The `$httpProvider` provider and `$http` service expose `defaults.transformRequest` and
     * `defaults.transformResponse` properties. If a request does not provide its own transformations
     * then these will be applied.
     *
     * You can augment or replace the default transformations by modifying these properties by adding to or
     * replacing the array.
     *
     * Angular provides the following default transformations:
     *
     * Request transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$http.defaults.transformRequest`):
     *
     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it
     *   into JSON format.
     *
     * Response transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse` and `$http.defaults.transformResponse`):
     *
     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).
     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.
     *
     *
     * ### Overriding the Default Transformations Per Request
     *
     * If you wish override the request/response transformations only for a single request then provide
     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties on the configuration object passed
     * into `$http`.
     *
     * Note that if you provide these properties on the config object the default transformations will be
     * overwritten. If you wish to augment the default transformations then you must include them in your
     * local transformation array.
     *
     * The following code demonstrates adding a new response transformation to be run after the default response
     * transformations have been run.
     *
     * ```js
     * function appendTransform(defaults, transform) {
     *
     *   // We can't guarantee that the default transformation is an array
     *   defaults = angular.isArray(defaults) ? defaults : [defaults];
     *
     *   // Append the new transformation to the defaults
     *   return defaults.concat(transform);
     * }
     *
     * $http({
     *   url: '...',
     *   method: 'GET',
     *   transformResponse: appendTransform($http.defaults.transformResponse, function(value) {
     *     return doTransform(value);
     *   })
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ## Caching
     *
     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default
     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).
     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified
     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without
     * sending a request to the server.
     *
     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in
     * the same way that real requests are.
     *
     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same
     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and
     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.
     *
     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with
     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the
     * {@link ng.$http#defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set
     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.
     *
     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom
     * cache object will be cached.
     *
     * ## Interceptors
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be
     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and
     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.
     *
     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):
     *
     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`
     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.
     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`
     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.
     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *       // optional method
     *       'request': function(config) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return config;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       },
     *
     *
     *
     *       // optional method
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *      'request': function(config) {
     *          // same as above
     *       },
     *
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *          // same as above
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Security Considerations
     *
     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:
     *
     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
     *
     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes
     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server
     * cooperation is required.
     *
     * ### JSON Vulnerability Protection
     *
     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into
     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To
     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `")]}',\n"`.
     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
     *
     * For example if your server needs to return:
     * ```js
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:
     * ```js
     * )]}',
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.
     *
     *
     * ### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection
     *
     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which
     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism
     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie
     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only
     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that
     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for
     * cross-domain requests.
     *
     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session
     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the
     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure
     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be
     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from
     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's
     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)
     * for added security.
     *
     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName
     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,
     * or the per-request config object.
     *
     *
     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be
     *    processed. The object has following properties:
     *
     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)
     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.
     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be turned
     *      to `?key1=value1&key2=value2` after the url. If the value is not a string, it will be
     *      JSONified.
     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.
     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing
     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the
     *      header will not be sent. Functions accept a config object as an argument.
     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.
     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.
     *    - **transformRequest** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request
     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}
     *    - **transformResponse** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request
     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}
     *    - **paramSerializer** - {string|function(Object<string,string>):string} - A function used to prepare string representation
     *      of request parameters (specified as an object).
     *      Is specified as string, it is interpreted as function registered in with the {$injector}.
     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
     *      caching.
     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}
     *      that should abort the request when resolved.
     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials)
     *      for more information.
     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see
     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
     *
     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the
     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`
     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a
     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that
     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into
     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the
     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:
     *
     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform
     *     functions.
     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.
     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.
     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.
     *
     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending
     *   requests. This is primarily meant to be used for debugging purposes.

     *
     * @requires $parse
     * @requires $sce
     *
     * @description
     *
     * Compiles a string with markup into an interpolation function. This service is used by the
     * HTML {@link ng.$compile $compile} service for data binding. See
     * {@link ng.$interpolateProvider $interpolateProvider} for configuring the
     * interpolation markup.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   var $interpolate = ...; // injected
     *   var exp = $interpolate('Hello {{name | uppercase}}!');
     *   expect(exp({name:'Angular'}).toEqual('Hello ANGULAR!');
     * ```
     *
     * `$interpolate` takes an optional fourth argument, `allOrNothing`. If `allOrNothing` is
     * `true`, the interpolation function will return `undefined` unless all embedded expressions
     * evaluate to a value other than `undefined`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   var $interpolate = ...; // injected
     *   var context = {greeting: 'Hello', name: undefined };
     *
     *   // default "forgiving" mode
     *   var exp = $interpolate('{{greeting}} {{name}}!');
     *   expect(exp(context)).toEqual('Hello !');
     *
     *   // "allOrNothing" mode
     *   exp = $interpolate('{{greeting}} {{name}}!', false, null, true);
     *   expect(exp(context)).toBeUndefined();
     *   context.name = 'Angular';
     *   expect(exp(context)).toEqual('Hello Angular!');
     * ```
     *
     * `allOrNothing` is useful for interpolating URLs. `ngSrc` and `ngSrcset` use this behavior.
     *
     * ####Escaped Interpolation
     * $interpolate provides a mechanism for escaping interpolation markers. Start and end markers
     * can be escaped by preceding each of their characters with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash).
     * It will be rendered as a regular start/end marker, and will not be interpreted as an expression
     * or binding.
     *
     * This enables web-servers to prevent script injection attacks and defacing attacks, to some
     * degree, while also enabling code examples to work without relying on the
     * {@link ng.directive:ngNonBindable ngNonBindable} directive.
     *
     * **For security purposes, it is strongly encouraged that web servers escape user-supplied data,
     * replacing angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;) with &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively, and replacing all
     * interpolation start/end markers with their escaped counterparts.**
     *
     * Escaped interpolation markers are only replaced with the actual interpolation markers in rendered
     * output when the $interpolate service processes the text. So, for HTML elements interpolated
     * by {@link ng.$compile $compile}, or otherwise interpolated with the `mustHaveExpression` parameter
     * set to `true`, the interpolated text must contain an unescaped interpolation expression. As such,
     * this is typically useful only when user-data is used in rendering a template from the server, or
     * when otherwise untrusted data is used by a directive.
     *
     * <example>
     *  <file name="index.html">
     *    <div ng-init="username='A user'">
     *      <p ng-init="apptitle='Escaping demo'">{{apptitle}}: \{\{ username = "defaced value"; \}\}
     *        </p>
     *      <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the
     *        application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly
     *        escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)
     *        characters.</p>
     *      <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed
     *        from the database by an administrator.</p>
     *    </div>
     *  </file>
     * </example>
     *
     * @param {string} text The text with markup to interpolate.
     * @param {boolean=} mustHaveExpression if set to true then the interpolation string must have
     *    embedded expression in order to return an interpolation function. Strings with no
     *    embedded expression will return null for the interpolation function.
     * @param {string=} trustedContext when provided, the returned function passes the interpolated
     *    result through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted(interpolatedResult,
     *    trustedContext)} before returning it.  Refer to the {@link ng.$sce $sce} service that
     *    provides Strict Contextual Escaping for details.
     * @param {boolean=} allOrNothing if `true`, then the returned function returns undefined
     *    unless all embedded expressions evaluate to a value other than `undefined`.
     * @returns {function(context)} an interpolation function which is used to compute the
     *    interpolated string. The function has these parameters:
     *
     * - `context`: evaluation context for all expressions embedded in the interpolated text

      * milliseconds.
      *
      * The return value of registering an interval function is a promise. This promise will be
      * notified upon each tick of the interval, and will be resolved after `count` iterations, or
      * run indefinitely if `count` is not defined. The value of the notification will be the
      * number of iterations that have run.
      * To cancel an interval, call `$interval.cancel(promise)`.
      *
      * In tests you can use {@link ngMock.$interval#flush `$interval.flush(millis)`} to

      * directive's element are destroyed.
      * You should take this into consideration and make sure to always cancel the interval at the
      * appropriate moment.  See the example below for more details on how and when to do this.
      * </div>
      *
      * @param {function()} fn A function that should be called repeatedly.
      * @param {number} delay Number of milliseconds between each function call.
      * @param {number=} [count=0] Number of times to repeat. If not set, or 0, will repeat
      *   indefinitely.
      * @param {boolean=} [invokeApply=true] If set to `false` skips model dirty checking, otherwise
      *   will invoke `fn` within the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply} block.

// Sandboxing Angular Expressions
// ------------------------------
// Angular expressions are generally considered safe because these expressions only have direct
// access to `$scope` and locals. However, one can obtain the ability to execute arbitrary JS code by
// obtaining a reference to native JS functions such as the Function constructor.
//
// As an example, consider the following Angular expression:
//
//   {}.toString.constructor('alert("evil JS code")')
//
// This sandboxing technique is not perfect and doesn't aim to be. The goal is to prevent exploits
// against the expression language, but not to prevent exploits that were enabled by exposing
// sensitive JavaScript or browser APIs on Scope. Exposing such objects on a Scope is never a good
// practice and therefore we are not even trying to protect against interaction with an object
// explicitly exposed in this way.
//
// In general, it is not possible to access a Window object from an angular expression unless a
// window or some DOM object that has a reference to window is published onto a Scope.
// Similarly we prevent invocations of function known to be dangerous, as well as assignments to
// native objects.
//

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $q
 * @requires $rootScope
 *
 * @description
 * A service that helps you run functions asynchronously, and use their return values (or exceptions)
 * when they are done processing.
 *
 * This is an implementation of promises/deferred objects inspired by
 * [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
 *
 * $q can be used in two fashions --- one which is more similar to Kris Kowal's Q or jQuery's Deferred
 * implementations, and the other which resembles ES6 promises to some degree.
 *
 * # $q constructor
 *
 * The streamlined ES6 style promise is essentially just using $q as a constructor which takes a `resolver`
 * function as the first argument. This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6 Harmony,
 * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
 *
 * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 Harmony promises are
 * available yet.
 *
 * It can be used like so:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.
 *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
 *       setTimeout(function() {
 *         if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *         } else {
 *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *         }
 *       }, 1000);
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.
 *
 * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.
 *
 * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an
 * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
 * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.
 *
 * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
 * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     var deferred = $q.defer();
 *
 *     setTimeout(function() {
 *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');
 *
 *       if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *       } else {
 *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *       }
 *     }, 1000);
 *
 *     return deferred.promise;
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   }, function(update) {
 *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
 * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see
 * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.
 *
 * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
 * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.
 * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the
 * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.
 *
 * # The Deferred API
 *
 * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.
 *
 * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
 * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status
 * of the task.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection
 *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.
 * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to
 *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.
 * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called
 *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.
 *
 * **Properties**
 *
 * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.
 *
 *
 * # The Promise API
 *
 * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
 * calling `deferred.promise`.
 *
 * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
 * of the deferred task when it completes.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or
 *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously
 *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result
 *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to
 *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.
 *
 *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback` (unless that value is a promise, in which case it is resolved
 *   with the value which is resolved in that promise using
 *   [promise chaining](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-promises-queues)).
 *   It also notifies via the return value of the `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be
 *   resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback method.
 *
 * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`
 *
 * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,
 *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some
 *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full
 *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for
 *   more information.
 *
 * # Chaining promises
 *
 * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily
 * possible to create a chain of promises:
 *
 * ```js
 *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
 *     return result + 1;
 *   });
 *
 *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value
 *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
 * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
 * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like
 * $http's response interceptors.
 *
 *
 * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q
 *
 *  There are two main differences:
 *
 * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation
 *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
 *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.
 * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
 *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.
 *
 *  # Testing
 *
 *  ```js
 *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
 *      var deferred = $q.defer();
 *      var promise = deferred.promise;
 *      var resolvedValue;
 *
 *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Simulate resolving of promise
 *      deferred.resolve(123);
 *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
 *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
 *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
 *      $rootScope.$apply();
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
 *    }));
 *  ```
 *
 * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or
 *   rejecting the newly created promise. The first parameter is a function which resolves the
 *   promise, the second parameter is a function which rejects the promise.
 *
 * @returns {Promise} The newly created promise.

/**
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - this means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in middle are expensive so we use linked list
 *
 * There are few watches then a lot of observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be
 * implemented in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of initialization function which
 * are expensive to construct.

     * A scope can inherit from a parent scope, as in this example:
     * ```js
         var parent = $rootScope;
         var child = parent.$new();

         parent.salutation = "Hello";
         expect(child.salutation).toEqual('Hello');

         child.salutation = "Welcome";
         expect(child.salutation).toEqual('Welcome');
         expect(parent.salutation).toEqual('Hello');
     * ```
     *
     * When interacting with `Scope` in tests, additional helper methods are available on the
     * instances of `Scope` type. See {@link ngMock.$rootScope.Scope ngMock Scope} for additional
     * details.
     *
     *
     * @param {Object.<string, function()>=} providers Map of service factory which need to be
     *                                       provided for the current scope. Defaults to {@link ng}.
     * @param {Object.<string, *>=} instanceCache Provides pre-instantiated services which should
     *                              append/override services provided by `providers`. This is handy
     *                              when unit-testing and having the need to override a default
     *                              service.
     * @returns {Object} Newly created scope.

       *
       * @description
       * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
       *
       * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
       *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (Since
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} reruns when it detects changes the
       *   `watchExpression` can execute multiple times per
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} and should be idempotent.)
       * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
       *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
       *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
       *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
       *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
       *   (see next point)
       * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
       *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
       *   later comparison, the {@link angular.copy} function is used. This therefore means that
       *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
       * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
       *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
       *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
       *
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Since `watchExpression`
       * can execute multiple times per {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle when a
       * change is detected, be prepared for multiple calls to your listener.)
       *
       * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
       * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
       * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
       * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
       * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
       * listener was called due to initialization.
       *
       *
       *

       * ```js

       * @ngdoc method
       * @name $rootScope.Scope#$digest
       * @kind function
       *
       * @description
       * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
       * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
       * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
       * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
       * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
       * iterations exceeds 10.
       *
       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
       *
       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           var scope = ...;
           scope.name = 'misko';
           scope.counter = 0;

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
           scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
             scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
           });
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

           scope.$digest();
           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes

 * @description
 *
 * `$sceDelegate` is a service that is used by the `$sce` service to provide {@link ng.$sce Strict
 * Contextual Escaping (SCE)} services to AngularJS.
 *
 * Typically, you would configure or override the {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} instead of
 * the `$sce` service to customize the way Strict Contextual Escaping works in AngularJS.  This is
 * because, while the `$sce` provides numerous shorthand methods, etc., you really only need to
 * override 3 core functions (`trustAs`, `getTrusted` and `valueOf`) to replace the way things
 * work because `$sce` delegates to `$sceDelegate` for these operations.
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} to configure this service.
 *
 * The default instance of `$sceDelegate` should work out of the box with little pain.  While you
 * can override it completely to change the behavior of `$sce`, the common case would
 * involve configuring the {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} instead by setting
 * your own whitelists and blacklists for trusting URLs used for loading AngularJS resources such as
 * templates.  Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist
 * $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlBlacklist}

 *
 * The `$sceDelegateProvider` provider allows developers to configure the {@link ng.$sceDelegate
 * $sceDelegate} service.  This allows one to get/set the whitelists and blacklists used to ensure
 * that the URLs used for sourcing Angular templates are safe.  Refer {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and
 * {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlBlacklist}
 *
 * For the general details about this service in Angular, read the main page for {@link ng.$sce
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)}.
 *
 * **Example**:  Consider the following case. <a name="example"></a>
 *
 * - your app is hosted at url `http://myapp.example.com/`
 * - but some of your templates are hosted on other domains you control such as
 *   `http://srv01.assets.example.com/`,  `http://srv02.assets.example.com/`, etc.
 * - and you have an open redirect at `http://myapp.example.com/clickThru?...`.
 *
 * Here is what a secure configuration for this scenario might look like:
 *
 * ```
 *  angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {
 *    $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist([
 *      // Allow same origin resource loads.
 *      'self',
 *      // Allow loading from our assets domain.  Notice the difference between * and **.
 *      'http://srv*.assets.example.com/**'

 *
 *    // The blacklist overrides the whitelist so the open redirect here is blocked.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $sce
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *
 * `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
 *
 * # Strict Contextual Escaping
 *
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain
 * contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.  One example of
 * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer
 * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.
 *
 * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.
 *
 * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE<11 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE<11 allow
 * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer
 * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.
 * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`
 * to the top of your HTML document.
 *
 * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for
 * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
 *
 * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
 *
 * ```
 * <input ng-model="userHtml" aria-label="User input">
 * <div ng-bind-html="userHtml"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE
 * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.
 * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via
 * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates
 * security vulnerabilities.)
 *
 * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
 * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
 *
 * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
 * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
 * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
 * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
 *
 * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
 * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
 * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
 * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
 * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
 * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
 * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.
 *
 * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
 * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
 * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.
 *
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
 * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the
 * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.
 *
 * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly
 * simplified):
 *
 * ```
 * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attr) {
 *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
 *       element.html(value || '');
 *     });
 *   };
 * }];
 * ```
 *
 * ## Impact on loading templates
 *
 * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
 * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
 *
 * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
 * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or
 * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist
 * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.
 *
 * *Please note*:
 * The browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
 * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
 * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## This feels like too much overhead
 *
 * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
 *
 * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
 * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.
 * `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works.
 *
 * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them
 * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.
 *
 * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
 * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
 * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
 * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.
 *
 * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
 * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
 * security onto an application later.
 *
 * <a name="contexts"></a>
 * ## What trusted context types are supported?
 *
 * | Context             | Notes          |
 * |---------------------|----------------|
 * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
 * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |
 * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |
 * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 *
 * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
 *
 *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
 *
 *  - **'self'**
 *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same
 *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
 *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
 *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource
 *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
 *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters
 *      match themselves.
 *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
 *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
 *      in a whitelist.
 *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not
 *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
 *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
 *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
 *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
 *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)
 *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax
 *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
 *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
 *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
 *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
 *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
 *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
 *      if they as a last resort.
 *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is
 *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
 *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
 *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
 *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
 *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
 *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
 *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
 *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
 *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has
 *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
 *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
 *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
 *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
 *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.

 * ## Can I disable SCE completely?

 * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
 * you're migrating them a module at a time.
 *
 * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
 *
 * ```
 * angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
 *   // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!
 *   // Do not use in new projects.
 *   $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 * });

  /* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.
   *
   * The API contract for the SCE delegate
   * -------------------------------------
   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:
   *
   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)
   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the
   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by
   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.
   *
   * - valueOf(value)
   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were
   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if
   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given
   *     such a value.
   *
   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)
   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by
   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.
   *
   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be
   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For
   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In
   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would
   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or
   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based
   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special
   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.
   *
   *
   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts
   * ------------------------------------------------
   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This
   * is purely an implementation details.
   *
   * The contract is simply this:
   *
   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)
   *     will also succeed.
   *
   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way.  In some future, we
   * may not use inheritance anymore.  That is OK because no code outside of
   * sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to be aware of this detail.

/**
 *
 * Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
 * results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
 * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
 * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
 * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
 * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See
 * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
 *
 * Implementation Notes for IE
 * ---------------------------
 * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
 * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
 * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
 * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
 * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
 * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.
 *
 * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one
 * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -
 * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.
 * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like "javascript:foo" on IE throws an exception.
 * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that
 * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name filter
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Selects a subset of items from `array` and returns it as a new array.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The source array.
 * @param {string|Object|function()} expression The predicate to be used for selecting items from
 *   `array`.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `string`: The string is used for matching against the contents of the `array`. All strings or
 *     objects with string properties in `array` that match this string will be returned. This also
 *     applies to nested object properties.
 *     The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.
 *
 *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained
 *     by `array`. For example `{name:"M", phone:"1"}` predicate will return an array of items
 *     which have property `name` containing "M" and property `phone` containing "1". A special
 *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:"text"}`) to accept a match against any
 *     property of the object or its nested object properties. That's equivalent to the simple
 *     substring match with a `string` as described above. The predicate can be negated by prefixing
 *     the string with `!`.
 *     For example `{name: "!M"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`
 *     not containing "M".
 *
 *     Note that a named property will match properties on the same level only, while the special
 *     `$` property will match properties on the same level or deeper. E.g. an array item like
 *     `{name: {first: 'John', last: 'Doe'}}` will **not** be matched by `{name: 'John'}`, but
 *     **will** be matched by `{$: 'John'}`.
 *
 *   - `function(value, index)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters. The
 *     function is called for each element of `array`. The final result is an array of those
 *     elements that the predicate returned true for.
 *
 * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in
 *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from
 *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `function(actual, expected)`:
 *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and
 *     should return true if both values should be considered equal.
 *
 *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(actual, expected)}`.
 *     This is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.
 *
 *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case
 *     insensitive way.
 *
 *     Primitive values are converted to strings. Objects are not compared against primitives,
 *     unless they have a custom `toString` method (e.g. `Date` objects).

 *   `format` string can contain literal values. These need to be escaped by surrounding with single quotes (e.g.

 *
 * @param {(Date|number|string)} date Date to format either as Date object, milliseconds (string or
 *    number) or various ISO 8601 datetime string formats (e.g. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ and its
 *    shorter versions like yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmZ, yyyy-MM-dd or yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ). If no timezone is
 *    specified in the string input, the time is considered to be in the local timezone.
 * @param {string=} format Formatting rules (see Description). If not specified,
 *    `mediumDate` is used.
 * @param {string=} timezone Timezone to be used for formatting. It understands UTC/GMT and the
 *    continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for
 *    example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *    If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.
 * @returns {string} Formatted string or the input if input is not recognized as date/millis.

 * @description
 * Creates a new array or string containing only a specified number of elements. The elements

 * the value and sign (positive or negative) of `limit`. If a number is used as input, it is
 * converted to a string.
 *
 * @param {Array|string|number} input Source array, string or number to be limited.
 * @param {string|number} limit The length of the returned array or string. If the `limit` number
 *     is positive, `limit` number of items from the beginning of the source array/string are copied.
 *     If the number is negative, `limit` number  of items from the end of the source array/string
 *     are copied. The `limit` will be trimmed if it exceeds `array.length`. If `limit` is undefined,
 *     the input will be returned unchanged.
 * @param {(string|number)=} begin Index at which to begin limitation. As a negative index, `begin`
 *     indicates an offset from the end of `input`. Defaults to `0`.
 * @returns {Array|string} A new sub-array or substring of length `limit` or less if input array
 *     had less than `limit` elements.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name orderBy
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Orders a specified `array` by the `expression` predicate. It is ordered alphabetically
 * for strings and numerically for numbers. Note: if you notice numbers are not being sorted
 * correctly, make sure they are actually being saved as numbers and not strings.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The array to sort.
 * @param {function(*)|string|Array.<(function(*)|string)>=} expression A predicate to be
 *    used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.
 *
 *    Can be one of:
 *
 *    - `function`: Getter function. The result of this function will be sorted using the
 *      `<`, `===`, `>` operator.
 *    - `string`: An Angular expression. The result of this expression is used to compare elements
 *      (for example `name` to sort by a property called `name` or `name.substr(0, 3)` to sort by
 *      3 first characters of a property called `name`). The result of a constant expression
 *      is interpreted as a property name to be used in comparisons (for example `"special name"`
 *      to sort object by the value of their `special name` property). An expression can be
 *      optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control ascending or descending sort order
 *      (for example, `+name` or `-name`). If no property is provided, (e.g. `'+'`) then the array
 *      element itself is used to compare where sorting.
 *    - `Array`: An array of function or string predicates. The first predicate in the array
 *      is used for sorting, but when two items are equivalent, the next predicate is used.
 *
 *    If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} reverse Reverse the order of the array.
 * @returns {Array} Sorted copy of the source array.
 *
 *
 * @example
 * The example below demonstrates a simple ngRepeat, where the data is sorted
 * by age in descending order (predicate is set to `'-age'`).
 * `reverse` is not set, which means it defaults to `false`.

 * @description
 *
 * This directive sets the `disabled` attribute on the element if the

 *
 * A special directive is necessary because we cannot use interpolation inside the `disabled`
 * attribute.  The following example would make the button enabled on Chrome/Firefox
 * but not on older IEs:
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- See below for an example of ng-disabled being used correctly -->
 * <div ng-init="isDisabled = false">
 *  <button disabled="{{isDisabled}}">Disabled</button>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * This is because the HTML specification does not require browsers to preserve the values of
 * boolean attributes such as `disabled` (Their presence means true and their absence means false.)
 * If we put an Angular interpolation expression into such an attribute then the
 * binding information would be lost when the browser removes the attribute.
 *
 * @example
    <example>
      <file name="index.html">
        <label>Click me to toggle: <input type="checkbox" ng-model="checked"></label><br/>

 /**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name form
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * Directive that instantiates
 * {@link form.FormController FormController}.
 *
 * If the `name` attribute is specified, the form controller is published onto the current scope under
 * this name.
 *
 * # Alias: {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`}
 *
 * In Angular, forms can be nested. This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child
 * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so
 * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to
 * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when
 * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`
 * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an
 * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.
 *
 *
 * # CSS classes
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.
 *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 *
 * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action
 *
 * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical
 * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full
 * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered
 * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.
 *
 * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the
 * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.
 *
 * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when
 * a form is submitted:
 *
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first
  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])
 *
 * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}
 * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.
 * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:
 *
 * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit
 * (`ngSubmit`)
 * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter
 * doesn't trigger submit
 * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then
 * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or
 * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)
 *
 * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is
 * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.
 * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any
 * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how
 * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well
 * as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-form {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-form.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
    <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="formExample">
      <file name="index.html">
       <script>
         angular.module('formExample', [])

        .my-form {
          -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;
          transition:all linear 0.5s;
          background: transparent;
        }
        .my-form.ng-invalid {
          background: red;
        }

   *
   * @description
   * Standard HTML text input with angular data binding, inherited by most of the `input` elements.
   *
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} required Adds `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel value does not match
   *    a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
   *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
   *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
   *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
   *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
   *    account.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
   *    interaction with the input element.
   * @param {boolean=} [ngTrim=true] If set to false Angular will not automatically trim the input.
   *    This parameter is ignored for input[type=password] controls, which will never trim the
   *    input.

     * Input with date validation and transformation. In browsers that do not yet support
     * the HTML5 date input, a text element will be used. In that case, text must be entered in a valid ISO-8601
     * date format (yyyy-MM-dd), for example: `2009-01-06`. Since many
     * modern browsers do not yet support this input type, it is important to provide cues to users on the
     * expected input format via a placeholder or label.
     *
     * The model must always be a Date object, otherwise Angular will throw an error.
     * Invalid `Date` objects (dates whose `getTime()` is `NaN`) will be rendered as an empty string.
     *
     * The timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model can be defined using
     * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions}. By default, this is the timezone of the browser.
     *
     * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
     * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
     * @param {string=} min Sets the `min` validation error key if the value entered is less than `min`. This must be a
     * valid ISO date string (yyyy-MM-dd).
     * @param {string=} max Sets the `max` validation error key if the value entered is greater than `max`. This must be
     * a valid ISO date string (yyyy-MM-dd).
     * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
     * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
     *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
     *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.

 * The `ngBind` attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element

 *
 * Typically, you don't use `ngBind` directly, but instead you use the double curly markup like
 * `{{ expression }}` which is similar but less verbose.
 *
 * It is preferable to use `ngBind` instead of `{{ expression }}` if a template is momentarily
 * displayed by the browser in its raw state before Angular compiles it. Since `ngBind` is an
 * element attribute, it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading.
 *
 * An alternative solution to this problem would be using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak} directive.
 *
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngClass
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngClass` directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding
 * an expression that represents all classes to be added.
 *
 * The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression
 * evaluates to:
 *
 * 1. If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class
 * names.
 *
 * 2. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the
 * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.
 *
 * 3. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should either be a string as in
 * type 1 or an object as in type 2. This means that you can mix strings and objects together in an array
 * to give you more control over what CSS classes appear. See the code below for an example of this.
 *
 *
 * The directive won't add duplicate classes if a particular class was already set.
 *
 * When the expression changes, the previously added classes are removed and only then are the
 * new classes added.

   ## Animations

   The example below demonstrates how to perform animations using ngClass.

   <example module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true">
     <file name="index.html">
      <input id="setbtn" type="button" value="set" ng-click="myVar='my-class'">
      <input id="clearbtn" type="button" value="clear" ng-click="myVar=''">
      <br>
      <span class="base-class" ng-class="myVar">Sample Text</span>
     </file>
     <file name="style.css">
       .base-class {
         -webkit-transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
         transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
       }

       .base-class.my-class {
         color: red;
         font-size:3em;
       }
     </file>
     <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
       it('should check ng-class', function() {
         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('setbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('clearbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);
       });
     </file>
   </example>


   ## ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations
   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.
   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder
   any pre-existing CSS transitions already on the element. To get an idea of what happens during a class-based animation, be sure
   to view the step by step details of {@link $animate#addClass $animate.addClass} and
   {@link $animate#removeClass $animate.removeClass}.

 * @description
 * The `ngCloak` directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly
 * displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this
 * directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.
 *
 * The directive can be applied to the `<body>` element, but the preferred usage is to apply
 * multiple `ngCloak` directives to small portions of the page to permit progressive rendering
 * of the browser view.
 *
 * `ngCloak` works in cooperation with the following css rule embedded within `angular.js` and
 * `angular.min.js`.
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```css
 * [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
 *   display: none !important;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When this css rule is loaded by the browser, all html elements (including their children) that
 * are tagged with the `ngCloak` directive are hidden. When Angular encounters this directive
 * during the compilation of the template it deletes the `ngCloak` element attribute, making
 * the compiled element visible.
 *
 * For the best result, the `angular.js` script must be loaded in the head section of the html
 * document; alternatively, the css rule above must be included in the external stylesheet of the
 * application.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngController
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngController` directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular
 * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
 *
 * MVC components in angular:
 *
 * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties
 *   are accessed through bindings.
 * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
 * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business
 *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values
 *
 * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition
 * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller
 * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached
 * and executed twice.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 500
 * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}
 * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.
 *
 * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying
 * `ng-controller="as propertyName"`.
 *
 * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may
 * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (not recommended).
 *
 * @example
 * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and
 * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can
 * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected
 * in the View without the need for a manual update.
 *
 * Two different declaration styles are included below:
 *
 * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController1 as settings"`
 * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController2"`
 *
 * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates
 * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller
 * and avoiding scope.
 *
 * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when
 * multiple controllers apply to an element.
 * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and
 * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.
 * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal
 * inheritance masking primitives.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.

 * For Angular to be CSP compatible there are only two things that we need to do differently:
 *
 * - don't use `Function` constructor to generate optimized value getters
 * - don't inject custom stylesheet into the document
 *
 * AngularJS uses `Function(string)` generated functions as a speed optimization. Applying the `ngCsp`
 * directive will cause Angular to use CSP compatibility mode. When this mode is on AngularJS will

 *
 * CSP forbids JavaScript to inline stylesheet rules. In non CSP mode Angular automatically
 * includes some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak}).
 * To make those directives work in CSP mode, include the `angular-csp.css` manually.
 *
 * Angular tries to autodetect if CSP is active and automatically turn on the CSP-safe mode. This
 * autodetection however triggers a CSP error to be logged in the console:
 *
 * ```
 * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of
 * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that
 * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
 * ```
 *
 * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`
 * directive on the root element of the application or on the `angular.js` script tag, whichever
 * appears first in the html document.
 *
 * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*
 *
 * @example
 * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.
   ```html
     <!doctype html>
     <html ng-app ng-csp>
     ...
     ...
     </html>
   ```

      // Note: the suffix `.csp` in the example name triggers
      // csp mode in our http server!

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngIf
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an
 * {expression}. If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false
 * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from
 * its parent scope using
 * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`
 * and `leave` effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - happens just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container
 * leave - happens just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 600
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree. If it is truthy a copy of the compiled
 *     element is added to the DOM tree.
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive

 *
 * @description
 * Fetches, compiles and includes an external HTML fragment.
 *
 * By default, the template URL is restricted to the same domain and protocol as the
 * application document. This is done by calling {@link $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on it. To load templates from other domains or protocols
 * you may either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist them} or
 * {@link $sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap them} as trusted values. Refer to Angular's {@link
 * ng.$sce Strict Contextual Escaping}.
 *
 * In addition, the browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy may further restrict whether the template is successfully loaded.
 * For example, `ngInclude` won't work for cross-domain requests on all browsers and for `file://`
 * access on some browsers.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - animation is used to bring new content into the browser.
 * leave - animation is used to animate existing content away.
 *
 * The enter and leave animation occur concurrently.
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 400
 *
 * @param {string} ngInclude|src angular expression evaluating to URL. If the source is a string constant,
 *                 make sure you wrap it in **single** quotes, e.g. `src="'myPartialTemplate.html'"`.
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate when a new partial is loaded.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll Whether `ngInclude` should call {@link ng.$anchorScroll
 *                  $anchorScroll} to scroll the viewport after the content is loaded.
 *
 *                  - If the attribute is not set, disable scrolling.
 *                  - If the attribute is set without value, enable scrolling.
 *                  - Otherwise enable scrolling only if the expression evaluates to truthy value.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngList
 *
 * @description
 * Text input that converts between a delimited string and an array of strings. The default
 * delimiter is a comma followed by a space - equivalent to `ng-list=", "`. You can specify a custom
 * delimiter as the value of the `ngList` attribute - for example, `ng-list=" | "`.
 *
 * The behaviour of the directive is affected by the use of the `ngTrim` attribute.
 * * If `ngTrim` is set to `"false"` then whitespace around both the separator and each
 *   list item is respected. This implies that the user of the directive is responsible for
 *   dealing with whitespace but also allows you to use whitespace as a delimiter, such as a
 *   tab or newline character.
 * * Otherwise whitespace around the delimiter is ignored when splitting (although it is respected
 *   when joining the list items back together) and whitespace around each list item is stripped
 *   before it is added to the model.

 * @ngdoc type
 * @name ngModel.NgModelController
 *
 * @property {string} $viewValue Actual string value in the view.
 * @property {*} $modelValue The value in the model that the control is bound to.
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $parsers Array of functions to execute, as a pipeline, whenever
       the control reads value from the DOM. The functions are called in array order, each passing
       its return value through to the next. The last return value is forwarded to the
       {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `$validators`} collection.

Parsers are used to sanitize / convert the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue
`$viewValue`}.

Returning `undefined` from a parser means a parse error occurred. In that case,
no {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `$validators`} will run and the `ngModel`
will be set to `undefined` unless {@link ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions.allowInvalid`}
is set to `true`. The parse error is stored in `ngModel.$error.parse`.

 *
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $formatters Array of functions to execute, as a pipeline, whenever
       the model value changes. The functions are called in reverse array order, each passing the value through to the
       next. The last return value is used as the actual DOM value.
       Used to format / convert values for display in the control.
 * ```js
 * function formatter(value) {
 *   if (value) {
 *     return value.toUpperCase();
 *   }
 * }
 * ngModel.$formatters.push(formatter);
 * ```
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $validators A collection of validators that are applied
 *      whenever the model value changes. The key value within the object refers to the name of the
 *      validator while the function refers to the validation operation. The validation operation is
 *      provided with the model value as an argument and must return a true or false value depending
 *      on the response of that validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$validators.validCharacters = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *   return /[0-9]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /[a-z]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /[A-Z]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /\W+/.test(value);
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $asyncValidators A collection of validations that are expected to
 *      perform an asynchronous validation (e.g. a HTTP request). The validation function that is provided
 *      is expected to return a promise when it is run during the model validation process. Once the promise
 *      is delivered then the validation status will be set to true when fulfilled and false when rejected.
 *      When the asynchronous validators are triggered, each of the validators will run in parallel and the model
 *      value will only be updated once all validators have been fulfilled. As long as an asynchronous validator
 *      is unfulfilled, its key will be added to the controllers `$pending` property. Also, all asynchronous validators
 *      will only run once all synchronous validators have passed.
 *
 * Please note that if $http is used then it is important that the server returns a success HTTP response code
 * in order to fulfill the validation and a status level of `4xx` in order to reject the validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$asyncValidators.uniqueUsername = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *
 *   // Lookup user by username
 *   return $http.get('/api/users/' + value).

 *        //username exists, this means validation fails
 *        return $q.reject('exists');
 *      }, function rejected() {

 *        return true;
 *      });
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $viewChangeListeners Array of functions to execute whenever the
 *     view value has changed. It is called with no arguments, and its return value is ignored.
 *     This can be used in place of additional $watches against the model value.
 *
 * @property {Object} $error An object hash with all failing validator ids as keys.
 * @property {Object} $pending An object hash with all pending validator ids as keys.
 *
 * @property {boolean} $untouched True if control has not lost focus yet.

 * @property {boolean} $pristine True if user has not interacted with the control yet.
 * @property {boolean} $dirty True if user has already interacted with the control.
 * @property {boolean} $valid True if there is no error.
 * @property {boolean} $invalid True if at least one error on the control.
 * @property {string} $name The name attribute of the control.

 * @description
 *
 * `NgModelController` provides API for the {@link ngModel `ngModel`} directive.
 * The controller contains services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting
 * and parsing. It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or
 * listening to DOM events.
 * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of
 * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.
 * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.
 * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example
 * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.
 *
 * @example
 * ### Custom Control Example
 * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve
 * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)
 * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.
 *
 * `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element
 * contents be edited in place by the user.
 *
 * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}
 * module to automatically remove "bad" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick="...">`).
 * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks
 * that content using the `$sce` service.
 *
 * <example name="NgModelController" module="customControl" deps="angular-sanitize.js">
    <file name="style.css">
      [contenteditable] {
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: white;
        min-height: 20px;
      }

   * @description
   * Update the view value.
   *
   * This method should be called when an input directive want to change the view value; typically,
   * this is done from within a DOM event handler.
   *
   * For example {@link ng.directive:input input} calls it when the value of the input changes and
   * {@link ng.directive:select select} calls it when an option is selected.
   *
   * If the new `value` is an object (rather than a string or a number), we should make a copy of the
   * object before passing it to `$setViewValue`.  This is because `ngModel` does not perform a deep
   * watch of objects, it only looks for a change of identity. If you only change the property of
   * the object then ngModel will not realise that the object has changed and will not invoke the
   * `$parsers` and `$validators` pipelines.
   *
   * For this reason, you should not change properties of the copy once it has been passed to
   * `$setViewValue`. Otherwise you may cause the model value on the scope to change incorrectly.
   *
   * When this method is called, the new `value` will be staged for committing through the `$parsers`
   * and `$validators` pipelines. If there are no special {@link ngModelOptions} specified then the staged
   * value sent directly for processing, finally to be applied to `$modelValue` and then the
   * **expression** specified in the `ng-model` attribute.
   *
   * Lastly, all the registered change listeners, in the `$viewChangeListeners` list, are called.
   *
   * In case the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions} directive is used with `updateOn`
   * and the `default` trigger is not listed, all those actions will remain pending until one of the
   * `updateOn` events is triggered on the DOM element.
   * All these actions will be debounced if the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions}
   * directive is used with a custom debounce for this particular event.
   *
   * Note that calling this function does not trigger a `$digest`.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModel
 *
 * @element input
 * @priority 1
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
 * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
 * which is created and exposed by this directive.
 *
 * `ngModel` is responsible for:
 *
 * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
 *   require.
 * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
 * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, touched/untouched, validation errors).
 * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`, `ng-touched`, `ng-untouched`) including animations.
 * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
 *
 * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
 * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
 * implicitly and added to the scope.
 *
 * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)
 *
 * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
 *    - {@link input[text] text}
 *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
 *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
 *    - {@link input[number] number}
 *    - {@link input[email] email}
 *    - {@link input[url] url}
 *    - {@link input[date] date}
 *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}
 *    - {@link input[time] time}
 *    - {@link input[month] month}
 *    - {@link input[week] week}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
 *
 * # CSS classes
 * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
 * depending on the validity of the model.
 *
 *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid
 *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid
 *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
 *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with
 *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred
 *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred
 *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
 * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
 * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
 * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
 * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-input {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-input.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
 * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="inputExample">
     <file name="index.html">
       <script>
        angular.module('inputExample', [])
          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
            $scope.val = '1';
          }]);
       </script>
       <style>
         .my-input {
           -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;
           transition:all linear 0.5s;
           background: transparent;
         }
         .my-input.ng-invalid {
           color:white;
           background: red;
         }
       </style>
       <p id="inputDescription">
        Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
        Integer is a valid value.
       </p>
       <form name="testForm" ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input"
                aria-describedby="inputDescription" />
       </form>
     </file>
 * </example>
 *
 * ## Binding to a getter/setter
 *
 * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a
 * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets
 * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this
 * for models that have an internal representation that's different from what the model exposes
 * to the view.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more
 * frequently than other parts of your code.
 * </div>
 *
 * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to an element that
 * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to
 * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See
 * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:
 *
 * @example
 * <example name="ngModel-getter-setter" module="getterSetterExample">
     <file name="index.html">
       <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <form name="userForm">
           <label>Name:
             <input type="text" name="userName"
                    ng-model="user.name"
                    ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }" />
           </label>
         </form>
         <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind="user.name()"></span></pre>
       </div>
     </file>
     <file name="app.js">
       angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])
         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
           var _name = 'Brian';
           $scope.user = {
             name: function(newName) {
              // Note that newName can be undefined for two reasons:
              // 1. Because it is called as a getter and thus called with no arguments
              // 2. Because the property should actually be set to undefined. This happens e.g. if the
              //    input is invalid
              return arguments.length ? (_name = newName) : _name;
             }
           };

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModelOptions
 *
 * @description
 * Allows tuning how model updates are done. Using `ngModelOptions` you can specify a custom list of
 * events that will trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only
 * takes place when a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.
 *
 * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might
 * be different from the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you
 * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`} on the relevant input field in
 * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.
 *
 * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`}
 * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is
 * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their
 * `name` attribute.
 *
 * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the
 * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * `ngModelOptions` has an effect on the element it's declared on and its descendants.
 *
 * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to the current model. Valid keys are:
 *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several
 *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that
 *     matches the default events belonging of the control.
 *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A
 *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a
 *     custom value for each event. For example:
 *     `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: {'default': 500, 'blur': 0} }"`
 *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did
 *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.
 *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to
       `ngModel` as getters/setters.
 *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for
 *     `<input type="date">`, `<input type="time">`, ... . It understands UTC/GMT and the

  The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the
  form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is
  pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.

  <example name="ngModelOptions-directive-blur" module="optionsExample">
    <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
        <form name="userForm">

                   ng-model="user.name"
                   ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'blur' }"
                   ng-keyup="cancel($event)" />
          </label><br />
          <label>Other data:
            <input type="text" ng-model="user.data" />
          </label><br />
        </form>

  This one shows how to debounce model changes. Model will be updated only 1 sec after last change.
  If the `Clear` button is pressed, any debounced action is canceled and the value becomes empty.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngOptions
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngOptions` attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of `<option>`
 * elements for the `<select>` element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the
 * `ngOptions` comprehension expression.
 *
 * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of `ngOptions` to achieve a
 * similar result. However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing memory and
 * increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing
 * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the
 * comprehension expression. `ngOptions` should be used when the `<select>` model needs to be bound
 *  to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at
 * present.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property
 * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`
 * directive.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)
 *
 * **Note:** By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important when
 * binding any input directive to a model that is an object or a collection.
 *
 * Since this is a common situation for `ngOptions` the directive additionally watches the model using
 * `$watchCollection` when the select has the `multiple` attribute or when there is a `track by` clause in
 * the options expression. This allows ngOptions to trigger a re-rendering of the options even if the actual
 * object/collection has not changed identity but only a property on the object or an item in the collection
 * changes.
 *
 * Note that `$watchCollection` does a shallow comparison of the properties of the object (or the items in the collection
 * if the model is an array). This means that changing a property deeper inside the object/collection that the
 * first level will not trigger a re-rendering.
 *
 *
 * ## `select` **`as`**
 *
 * Using `select` **`as`** will bind the result of the `select` expression to the model, but
 * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)
 * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a **`track by`** expression
 * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.
 *
 *
 * ### `select` **`as`** and **`track by`**
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * Do not use `select` **`as`** and **`track by`** in the same expression. They are not designed to work together.
 * </div>
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <select ng-options="item.subItem as item.label for item in values track by item.id" ng-model="selected">
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * $scope.values = [{
 *   id: 1,
 *   label: 'aLabel',
 *   subItem: { name: 'aSubItem' }
 * }, {
 *   id: 2,
 *   label: 'bLabel',
 *   subItem: { name: 'bSubItem' }
 * }];
 *
 * $scope.selected = { name: 'aSubItem' };
 * ```
 *
 * With the purpose of preserving the selection, the **`track by`** expression is always applied to the element
 * of the data source (to `item` in this example). To calculate whether an element is selected, we do the
 * following:
 *
 * 1. Apply **`track by`** to the elements in the array. In the example: `[1, 2]`
 * 2. Apply **`track by`** to the already selected value in `ngModel`.
 *    In the example: this is not possible as **`track by`** refers to `item.id`, but the selected
 *    value from `ngModel` is `{name: 'aSubItem'}`, so the **`track by`** expression is applied to
 *    a wrong object, the selected element can't be found, `<select>` is always reset to the "not
 *    selected" option.
 *
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
 *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
 *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
 * @param {comprehension_expression=} ngOptions in one of the following forms:
 *
 *   * for array data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` | orderBy:`orderexpr` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *        (for including a filter with `track by`)
 *   * for object data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`disable when`** `disable`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *   * `array` / `object`: an expression which evaluates to an array / object to iterate over.
 *   * `value`: local variable which will refer to each item in the `array` or each property value
 *      of `object` during iteration.
 *   * `key`: local variable which will refer to a property name in `object` during iteration.
 *   * `label`: The result of this expression will be the label for `<option>` element. The
 *     `expression` will most likely refer to the `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).
 *   * `select`: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent `<select>`
 *      element. If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.
 *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`
 *      DOM element.
 *   * `disable`: The result of this expression will be used to disable the rendered `<option>`
 *      element. Return `true` to disable.
 *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be
 *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the
 *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`). With this the selection is preserved
 *      even when the options are recreated (e.g. reloaded from the server).

 * and the strings to be displayed.
 *
 * # Plural categories and explicit number rules
 * There are two
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * in Angular's default en-US locale: "one" and "other".
 *
 * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, "other" can match
 * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the
 * explicit number rule for "3" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories
 * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize
 * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.
 * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.
 *
 * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression
 * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.
 *
 * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual
 * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.
 *
 * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount"
                 when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 *```
 *
 * In the example, `"0: Nobody is viewing."` is an explicit number rule. If you did not
 * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the "other" category and "0 people are viewing"
 * would be shown instead of "Nobody is viewing". You can specify an explicit number rule for
 * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing "12 people are viewing", you can
 * show "a dozen people are viewing".
 *
 * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted
 * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with
 * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder
 * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.
 *
 * If no rule is defined for a category, then an empty string is displayed and a warning is generated.
 * Note that some locales define more categories than `one` and `other`. For example, fr-fr defines `few` and `many`.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset
 * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in
 * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message "4 people are viewing this document",
 * you might display "John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document".
 * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.
 * Let's take a look at an example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount" offset=2
 *               when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',
 *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',
 *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added
 * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.
 * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, "John is viewing" will be shown.
 * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so
 * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.
 * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and "John, Mary and one other person are viewing"
 * is shown.
 *
 * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for
 * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,
 * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for
 * plural categories "one" and "other".
 *
 * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.
 * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.
 * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngRepeat
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngRepeat` directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template
 * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,
 * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.
 *
 * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:
 *
 * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |
 * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |
 * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |
 * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |
 * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |
 * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |
 * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |
 *
 * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.
 * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.
 *
 *
 * # Iterating over object properties
 *
 * It is possible to get `ngRepeat` to iterate over the properties of an object using the following
 * syntax:
 *
 * ```js
 * <div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj"> ... </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You need to be aware that the JavaScript specification does not define the order of keys
 * returned for an object. (To mitigate this in Angular 1.3 the `ngRepeat` directive
 * used to sort the keys alphabetically.)
 *
 * Version 1.4 removed the alphabetic sorting. We now rely on the order returned by the browser
 * when running `for key in myObj`. It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
 * keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions when keys are deleted
 * and reinstated. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues
 *
 * If this is not desired, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array
 * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`.  You could
 * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)
 * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.
 *
 *
 * # Tracking and Duplicates
 *
 * When the contents of the collection change, `ngRepeat` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 *
 * By default, `ngRepeat` does not allow duplicate items in arrays. This is because when
 * there are duplicates, it is not possible to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection
 * items and DOM elements.
 *
 * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior
 * with your own using the `track by` expression.
 *
 * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the
 * special scope property `$index`:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You may use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions
 * on the scope:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * If you are working with objects that have an identifier property, you can track
 * by the identifier instead of the whole object. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`
 * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the
 * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="model in collection track by model.id">
 *      {{model.name}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in
 * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="obj in collection track by $id(obj)">
 *      {{obj.prop}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * # Special repeat start and end points
 * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending
 * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.
 * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)
 * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.
 *
 * The example below makes use of this feature:
 * ```html
 *   <header ng-repeat-start="item in items">
 *     Header {{ item }}
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 *   <footer ng-repeat-end>
 *     Footer {{ item }}
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:
 * ```html
 *   <header>
 *     Header A
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body A
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer A
 *   </footer>
 *   <header>
 *     Header B
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body B
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer B
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such
 * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).
 *
 * @animations
 * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter
 *
 * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out
 *
 * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 1000
 * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These
 *   formats are currently supported:
 *
 *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`
 *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.
 *
 *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,
 *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression
 *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression
 *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have
 *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are
 *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)  If filters are used in the expression, they should be
 *     applied before the tracking expression.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements
 *     will be associated by item identity in the array.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique
 *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements
 *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM
 *     element in the same way in the DOM.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this
 *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`
 *     property is same.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter
 *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the
 *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message
 *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after
 *     the items have been processed through the filter.
 *
 *     Please note that `as [variable name] is not an operator but rather a part of ngRepeat micro-syntax so it can be used only at the end
 *     (and not as operator, inside an expression).
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter : x | orderBy : order | limitTo : limit as results` .
 *
 * @example
 * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and
 * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngShow
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngShow` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression
 * provided to the `ngShow` attribute. The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding
 * the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined
 * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue"></div>
 *
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue" class="ng-hide"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a falsy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class
 * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When truthy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed
 * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.
 *
 * ## Why is !important used?
 *
 * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector
 * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple
 * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.
 * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.
 *
 * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector
 * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the
 * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.
 *
 * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`
 *
 * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change
 * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`
 * class CSS. Note that the selector that needs to be used is actually `.ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate)` to cope
 * with extra animation classes that can be added.
 *
 * ```css
 * .ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate) {
 *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/
 *   display: block!important;
 *   position: absolute;
 *   top: -9999px;
 *   left: -9999px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.
 *
 * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`
 *
 * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression
 * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that
 * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property
 * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.
 *
 * ```css
 * //
 * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page
 * //
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {
 *   /&#42; this is required as of 1.3x to properly
 *      apply all styling in a show/hide animation &#42;/
 *   transition: 0s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add-active,
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove-active {
 *   /&#42; the transition is defined in the active class &#42;/
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display
 * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.
 *
 * @animations
 * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible
 * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy
 *     then the element is shown or hidden respectively.

 * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngHide` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to visible
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngSwitch
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.
 * Elements within `ngSwitch` but without `ngSwitchWhen` or `ngSwitchDefault` directives will be preserved at the location
 * as specified in the template.
 *
 * The directive itself works similar to ngInclude, however, instead of downloading template code (or loading it
 * from the template cache), `ngSwitch` simply chooses one of the nested elements and makes it visible based on which element
 * matches the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
 * (where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`on="..."` attribute**
 * (or the **`ng-switch="..."` attribute**), define any inner elements inside of the directive and place
 * a when attribute per element. The when attribute is used to inform ngSwitch which element to display when the on
 * expression is evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the default
 * attribute is displayed.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * Be aware that the attribute values to match against cannot be expressions. They are interpreted
 * as literal string values to match against.
 * For example, **`ng-switch-when="someVal"`** will match against the string `"someVal"` not against the
 * value of the expression `$scope.someVal`.
 * </div>

 * @animations
 * enter - happens after the ngSwitch contents change and the matched child element is placed inside the container
 * leave - happens just after the ngSwitch contents change and just before the former contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @usage
 *
 * ```
 * <ANY ng-switch="expression">
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue1">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue2">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-default>...</ANY>
 * </ANY>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 1200
 * @param {*} ngSwitch|on expression to match against <code>ng-switch-when</code>.
 * On child elements add:
 *
 * * `ngSwitchWhen`: the case statement to match against. If match then this
 *   case will be displayed. If the same match appears multiple times, all the
 *   elements will be displayed.
 * * `ngSwitchDefault`: the default case when no other case match. If there
 *   are multiple default cases, all of them will be displayed when no other
 *   case match.

 * HTML `SELECT` element with angular data-binding.
 *
 * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of {@link ng.directive:ngOptions
 * ngOptions} to achieve a similar result. However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing
 * memory and increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing
 * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the
 * comprehension expression.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property
 * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`
 * directive.
 *
 * If the viewValue contains a value that doesn't match any of the options then the control
 * will automatically add an "unknown" option, which it then removes when this is resolved.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * The value of a `select` directive used without `ngOptions` is always a string.
 * When the model needs to be bound to a non-string value, you must either explictly convert it
 * using a directive (see example below) or use `ngOptions` to specify the set of options.
 * This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at present.
 * </div>
